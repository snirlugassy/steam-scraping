                "text": "This is my first review on steam ever. I felt it was kind of my duty to give my opinion on the game that I have personally been waiting for over 6 years, as Warband happens to be -if not the- one of my all time favourite games (with around 1100 hours of gamplay - yes I know, still rookie numbers compared to some other of its fans, but still, that's a considerable amount of my life's time).So, I have -as of now- played 63 hours of Bannerlord and another 155 hours of the multiplayer beta of which I had the honor of being a part. I now feel confident enough to talk about why I think that you should get the game yourself, especially if you loved any of its previous titles.First of all, the game is aesthetically a HUGE development from the awkward indie 2010 (that -even then- still felt older) graphics, which we all grew to love. The animations seem more realistic, the items more detailed, the campaign map is incredible and the scenery (from the snowy forests of Sturgia to the desert wastelands of the Aserai homeland, and from the rocky Battanian villages to the great cities of the Empire) is beautiful and at times even -dare I say- majestic. Sure, the graphics still don't compare to the other big games of its time, and the character models still look a bit odd, but for a game of a small company like Taleworlds that chooses to focus more on the gameplay and the game's mechanics, you can at least overlook some of their flaws.I should also point out here that the game takes place around 200 years before the events of Warband, in a world where the Calradic Empire still exists, although in crisis, and new and old kingdoms arise in its wake. Some of the factions are the ones that evolved into the ones in Warband (Vlandia is the predecessor to the Swadians and the Rhodoks, Sturgia is a mix between the Vaegirs and the Nords, the Khuzaits are the khanate before the rise of the Khergits, and the Aserai the previous Sultanate to the Sarranids), while we also have the Battanians (a celtic-like mountain kingdom) and the Calradic Empire (an empire very similar to the medieval Greco-Roman -now known as Byzantine- Empire). Each of these factions is very well made in order to feel unique and different to the others, with its own architecture, clothing style and troops, that are very close to their historical inspirations, giving you a nice depiction of some fields of what the actual medieval world looked like (and in some cases how it worked).Now, for Single Player, on a first look you'd say \"That's an enhanced version of Warband\" and you'd may be right for the most part, but the game offers many new features and details that differentiate it from its predecessor. Examples of this are the many convenience options, like the way you can recruit troops from villages and towns which can be more and better if you have good relations with the village's notables or the fact that you can see the full items' stats and compare them to your own. There are many new features, like the Clan and its mechanics (basically you, your family and your companions), the fact that you can have children and continue to play as them once your older character finally kicks the bucket, the forging system which allows you to make weapons and choose how they will look on your own, the new Kingdom Mechanics, that enhance the experience of serving or ruling a realm with multiple armies and kingdom laws, and the fact that you can now kill nobles that you capture, with whatever consequences that may entail. Other features have been renewed, fixing annoying issues that existed in Warband or completely changing the way they worked for the better, like, for example, the new massive battles with more thought out AI-planning, and the sieges, that now have siege weapons and are not just a mass of angry people cramming a small ladder only to get violently killed by the other mass of angry people that awaits them on the walls.For Multiplayer, there are now 3 main modes, which are Skirmish 6v6 (which is like battle and conquest together), Captain 6v6 (which allows every player to command a small band of troops) and Siege (which is the good ol' siege we all know and love, polished with siege weapons and some new mechanics). There is also a Team Deathmatch mode which is more like a playground to prepare you for the real modes above. Now, the way the combat works is almost the same as in Warband (with some minor changes like a shield bash move, a crouch move and chain attacks) and I feel like it is what we should expect, even though I hear complaints about it being \"clunky\" and \"unreliable\". I personally enjoy it as I did in Warband and I'd say it is highly dependent on skill and experience (I believe it's hard to learn and to master, but once you do, it offers you a very fun and challenging experience). Of course, there are still many issues and bugs which make you question the fact that this is a game that was in development for 8 years and that it is priced as much as it is. If you buy it now, mind that you will come across a lot of them. That being said, you should also keep in mind that this is still Early Acccess and many of them are bound to change. Also, you have to AT LEAST give credit to the developers for keeping track with the complaints and the feedback of the players, having already made 10 updates (during the first 10-11 days since the release!) and continuing strong. Honestly, the way they keep hunting for issues and bugs and the way they listen to negative feedback is all I could ask from a game studio (which, again, is not a major one) and, if anything, deserves my support in this journey of making the game that we all have dreamt and still dream of.Overall (and sorry for this lengthy essay), the game is a worthy successor to Warband. It offers you a pretty similar experience that Warband did (letting you explore a vast world of different cultures and giving you the freedom to make your own story, whether it is of the journeys of a merchant, the adventures of a warlord, the path of terror left behind by a bandit leader, or the rise of a new ruler) which is exactly what we should all have expected and hoped for. And yet, even as a game that offers content and possibilities the size (and even significantly bigger than the size) of Warband, it still feels like it has not even scratched the surface of what it is capable of, leaving space to be filled in ways that we haven't even immagined by the many and various mods that are bound to follow (and have already started making their entrance) by the ever restless and creative modding community of Mount&Blade. So, if you have waited for this game like I have and still wonder if you should buy it in its current state I'd say, yes, join this journey, because even if it's not yet all you have dreamt of, given time and support it's going to be. If you are new to Mount&Blade, and think that it is a little overpriced for a game that is not fully completed yet, you can always wait until it comes out of EA, but I would personally recommend that you give it a go, and in the end you will be glad you did.",

                "text": "With 2,192 hours in Warband, I think it's safe to say that I've experienced my fair share of the classic Warband experience that Bannerlord is not only trying to emulate but also build upon. With 15 hours in the game, I'm already of the belief that Taleworlds will not only achieve this end, but surpass it.The game is buggy, yes. Some of the bugs are obnoxious, yes. There are portions of content missing that are sorely needed. Not only is this true, but the disappointment surrounding it is understandable. After 8 years of waiting, 10 for some, this series has cultivated a cult following of dedicated and loving fans, myself very much included, who want nothing more than to dive head first into the game.But it's very much an early access and anyone who finds themselves overly disappointed by the state of the game needs to remind themselves that it is still in its infancy. Even now, the content included in the game is entertaining; compared to Warband, combat actually feels weighty, and adventuring around Calradia has a heightened sense of danger and excitement to it. Side activities such as smithing allow for those interested in roleplay to create deeper stories for their characters, and core mechanics such as trading have been developed and enhanced in this new release to feel far more responsive and rewarding.It is clear from the two very quick patches it has already seen that this early access is one that Taleworlds are committed to building upon. Bugs will be worked out, content will be added, and I am firmly of the faith that the game will continue to evolve and take shape over the coming days, weeks and months. Everyone is well within their rights to leave a negative review, but I would encourage people not to damage the game's rating unfairly, as the current release is not indicative of the finished product.The thing that Bannerlord needs right now is committed players to continue to highlight issues so that they can be resolved. The framework provided to us now sets a good vision for the final product, and I can't wait to see that vision be fulfilled.",

Where I was promptly ambushed by brigands, who *let me go* because I was *too* poor. At some point I realized I'd lived my entire life in poverty, misery and eventually I decided to turn my life around.I became a blacksmith, created some minor works - barely making a profit. Until one day, when I made a sword that broke the town's economy. Everyone wanted my sword. In merely a day, I'd earned enough to purchase largess too grand for even kings. Then my life - so deprived in years gone by - was filled but still empty. Money begets money, and violence begets violence. Eventually, when I had conquered the world I knew nothing but stillness. My clan was large and thus was my lot.  Eventually life was bleak, if a man could have anything, would he want for nothing? Or did it mean he could not desire anything, as well? Then, it was 3 am and I realized I had work in the morning.All in all, ten out of ten, would Bannerlord again.",

                "text": "Great game... who need 1 or 2 years of development. tl;dr: mid game turn into a micromanagment hell.The game is fantastic until a certain point. You start as a mercenary, one party, 50-150 soldiers doing missions, small battles or bigger fights joining armies. Good graphics, brutal engagments with 200-1000 units at the same time if your computer can handle, playing as a soldier is a blast.The problems start when you get a few towns and a bigger family, the micromanagement never stops and gets worse overtime. You have to physically move your party to towns to fix their issues. When your lords get captured & escapes, they'll go into a random town until you pick em again, then you'll have to reform the party. Same with caravanes for trading, if they get captured, you'll have to go in his town and recreate the caravan. You have to partially fill towns with soldiers, manually, from your own soldiers. All the little fun things of the beginning soon become a hassle, as you can't delegate. Messengers are not a thing.You can't manage a town at a distance, you can't tell a party member to move to a location or guard a territory, they do whatever they want if they're out of your army / party, so you have to do it yourself. Either you're leading your huge army to fight what is basically an enless war mid game, or you take care of your cities while the rest of your faction fight... with various success. Some commanders are pretty good, other will throw waves of recruits at highly trained arbalists in the open backed with cavalry. Protip: don't be a recruit in an imperial army.You can't tell a party you created to guard an area or to kill all bandits attacking your villagers, it's up to you, or the IA if it feel like it. Worst, if you let the parties you created roam around (parties = group of 70-200 soldiers under a lord) they can be (temporarily) drafted in other armies of your kingdom... and you'll have to physically move to the army, talk to the leader and pay some reputation to get them back. Of course, large armies are slow. This leads the the next problem, swarms.My worst fear is not a massive army, it's an army disbanded in the middle of my territory. The small parties usually start raiding all villages in the vicinity while being too fast to be catched by a big army. Raided villages impact your town / castle loyalty and gold quite heavily. Sure, you could disband your army and hunt them yourself... but that makes you take a step back, and all your parties would reform under another army you can't control. And man, some army commanders are really, really stupid. Verdun style charge in the open against walls of archers, cavalry in a forest vs pikemens, you name it. I can't count the time i had parties wiped in someone else army. But let's say you managed to capture the lords burning your villages.The capture system is broken. Captured lords escape A LOT. I had some escape 20 seconds after being captured. They never stay in a jail for more than a few in game days. Once they escape, they magically teleport to their hometown, rebuild a fast 80 mens army in the blink of an eye and go back to raiding villages. AI \"cheat\" with recruits, they will always find soldiers in town, even if they're empty for you. Executions you say?If you execute a lord, no matter how much of an A-hole he/she is, the whole faction will hate you. He raided dozens of villages and killed hundreds of peasants? Still not good enough. You just can't kill a lord without suffering heavy consequences down the line, and you'll need those lords to be friendly later. Worth to mention, capturing the leader of a faction won't stop a war.Last - peace / war is on/off. I had 600 days of continuous war, followed by 600 days of complete peace in the entire map (due to a bug apparently), and i'm now back at 300 days of war. Not a single day of peace, when one war stop another start immediatly. They will just never, ever stop fighting. Can't catch a breath, can't leave the front of your lose towns.Oh and the main quest randomly failed after 875 days or so.I would still recommand the game, it's really fun for a while but it need a HUGE QoL update.",

                "text": "Short version: If there was a tentative recommendation button, I'd be using it. It very much depends on the person, because while most people praise the game, there is a serious contingent that have reasons not to. The company has a history of promising big things and then using a second game to finish fulfilling them. If that turns you off, I don't blame you. It doesn't bother me as long as the first game is good in its own right, but I can agree that we shouldn't have to buy a second game to get what was promised. It's a good core for a game, but there are plenty of bugs I've seen. I tried walking the streets of Baltikhand and had a CTD while loading them in. I repeated the process to verify that the crash was a consistent thing. So stay off the streets of that town and just hit the trade and recruitment screens there. I'm having issues with attribute points not being given to me at every third level like they're supposed to be. I'm sure it'll get fixed but as of this review I haven't seen it happen. Also having a hard time leveling up charm skill despite following the instructions given in the tooltip. Not sure if it's a true bug, or if the tooltip isn't telling the whole story. I'll have to wait and see. All that being said, I adore what this game is doing with the series. We have families now. Not just a marriage for an alliance, but an actual clan, with potential for children, and a brother built right into the story. We're the head of a clan, not just a nobody adventurer making it on their own. It's very Crusader Kings II to me, and I'm loving everything I get into. There's even a politics system where we can spend influence to vote on land assignment, and we can spend that influence to put laws up to vote that have actual impacts on the stability and power balances within our Kingdoms. Being a vassal doesn't just have to mean warring, we can use our built in influence to do politics as well. Overall, I love it. If you're on the fence and don't want to spend 40 or 50 dollars on it yet, wishlist it, watch the patch notes, and see how it looks when it goes on sale for real. For the rest of you, I understand the hate and don't blame you. I just don't share it, and I recommend anyone with an interest at least keep an eye on it.Update: 400 hours in and almost a year after release, they've done a lot of bugfixing. They've also done a bit of fleshing out and adding in features. I can definitely say I've already gotten my money's worth from it, and I've been YouTubing it as well. It still suffers some problems from the old games so far. The combat gets samey and isn't all that balanced. There seems to be a big tendency toward telling things rather than showing them proper, and this isn't helped by gameplay and story segregation. Though I could honestly see the gameplay and story segregation being intentional. There IS a main quest chain with a story to it, and there's room to interpret that quest as pretty much poking holes in a lot of the flavor text. Again, not sure if intentional and if it is it's not really that smart a move on their part, but it's there if you want to read into it.I'm still giving the game my tentative yes. If you like the series and just want more Warband, this is definitely for you. If not, keep watching or look into other games.",

                "text": "Great game. Started playing during the second lockdown. Finished the game to the point of having my own empire, reaching the ability to fight multiple wars with over 380 troops in my personal army. Ambushed by groups of 800-100 and held small passages with 150 fian champions, a shield wall and just enough cavalry to route the enemy. Had every companion in my personal bodyguard unit and was run down by a flanking cavalary charge, most of my unit was dismounted, we had to fight our way back to our line. Ordered our shieldwall to take tremendous losses to get us back into the fighting. Creating a tusudo (square formation) around the companions and bodyguard unit while we fought against the 2 v 1 odds (realistic difficulty). Lost 90% of my army, most of my companions but we won that battle. When we get out, we siege the enemy castle with just enough soldiers to push the ram. We knock down the reinforced doors and engage in a skirmish. The companions start to fall, members who were with me from the beginning. My troops are outnumbered, holding a small room near the gate. The balance of power is slowly creeping in the right direction. We are down to the last 20 enemies. We have 9 of us left, holding the doorway the best that we can. I take a javelin to the head, instant K.O. My units keep fighting, my bodyguard with insane leadership and tactics, reforms the wall and finds 30 or so troops that I mismanaged to come around and flank. I watch the battle incapacitated, the units left on our side is under 10. The units left on there side is under 10. We get to 3 each, companions vs. enemy leaders. My wife is one of the companions, my brother Nogrand is the other. The last companion is a surgeon who somehow made it this far. He dies but not before he throws a perfect javelin and takes one of the enemy commanders. Nogrand and my wife are melee specialists, almost maxed fighting stats with pillaged level 6 weapons. They hold, they wound both the last commanders. We take the castle, executing the commanders. But this isn't over. We, 265 wounded, an effective fighting force of 2 with my character health at 1% are about to come under siege from a nearby army. The nearby army sets the castle under siege. Hours turn to days, the army of 600 is ready to fight and in the distance I see our last hope. I see the first lord I recruited in my battle against the empire. The lord I spent years chasing as a mercenary, relentlessly beating in battle to gain charm points... he with an army of 400 is charging this way in what looks like a rally to protect is king, his commander, his lord! He stops and watches my no save, death on, realistic campaign's final moments. He sits there, watching this enemy army take down our walls with trebs and in the last second... just as they start to storm the gates, my number 2, my favourite lord... just sits there. We lose the campaign, we fight to the end and with a valiant last stand my party is killed in battle. It is over, my sons killed, my wife murdered and staring at my 300 hours campaign, satisfied that the next time; i'm going to behead that lord and his entire family the first time we meet. Until next time... 10/10",

Significant quality of life improvements here.The whole game is vanilla, rough, unbalanced.Some mechanics don't work yet, or work poorly. Like don't try to get your brother married, it won't work. Don't get married, don't save your brother. You can, but you might not be able to access their inventories.Main quest can be impossible to complete.. you can only complete as vassal, the game doesn't know you are an independent faction when you are in fact.. an independent faction.Troop trees are rough and basic and copy-paste vanilla values, uninteresting to explore.Characters can be missing, impossible to find, stuck in some castle while in fact are not in that castle. The game points to Location A when in fact you can find them in Location B, somewhere probably.. near Location A. Or not.Characters can sometimes be teleporting around like Nonsense.Smithing, which I like a lot.. is beyond OP and completely crazy broken. Mild spoilers.. at least for now, until they fix their sht.. While Workshops are very hard to figure out, make very little, and most will not make any money at all. As in: zero.Kingdom features are broken or questionable. Like Clans, which are now your vassals, they are a mess. Instead of getting auto-offers from AI, Clans are hard to get, easy to lose and unfairly destroy relations. This makes Kingdom almost impossible.Peace offers from the AI will not happen. But you can buy peace with money, and since money is not an issue atm, it's just silly.Parties are poorly maintained AI armies that you pay for, they do not auto-recruit, but will get themselves captured and will waste valuable troops.Sieges have various issues. Like 1 guy unreachable forever will make you fail the siege. Troops management is a mess. Broken walls could be more like messy bottlenecks, but sometimes are simply turning a siege into a field battle, aka.. not much sieging gameplay if you simply break walls. Opening gates from the inside is tough, but when it works, it's silly and OP. I also had a few crashes after sieges.Most castles are not yet in game, there are just a few, and a ton of copy-paste, so not much interest in sieging the same castle again and again.XP seems pretty broken, it's extremely easy to get to around lvl 13-15ish, and then.. pfff. XP requirements for companions are simply broken. They will not lvl up, not this century at least. You finish the game and they are still 1-2 lvls away from where they started.Executions are.. a questionable feature, that simply splits the game in: either you do it, play a quicker, much simpler and more repetitive game, make a ton of enemies, potentially ruin your character, ruin diplomacy, be forced to go down the genocide path.. and bypass any reason to siege or make a Kingdom. Or not do it, play the long game of building good relations with the nobility, but miss all the murdering fun, secretly wish you could do it, and cry yourself to sleep every night. And end up in a mess with your Kingdom anyway. The problem here is.. you can easily lamify the game by executing all nobles. And instead of a juicy, rewarding, emotionally messy and mechanically complex end game, you just chop chop chop chop chop... THE END.The UI again! Needs more clarity, focus, better framing, better organisation, less clutter, more consistency and polish. Upgrades are hard to figure out at first, a bit odd, and the grey shield icons over the Skills that can upgrade are simply not visible enough, they should be Colorful Bright Glowy Animated [with a color that stands out]! Personally I prefer the grid structure of the Warband inventory.The frequent, entirely useless, and poorly designed autosave.. doesn't async save in the background. It freezes the game for a few seconds. You can't turn it off.And for now.. some crashes may happen, depending on how you play and what you may try.Last but not least.. press N to access the Encyclopedia! There should be a large button for it in the main UI/world view, it's essential!Cheers!",

                "text": "Update 1: 6/4/20 - Devs have been aggressively patching the game since release. This is more than great news. If they keep up the good work we'll probably have a fully-featured working game much sooner than anticipated:).Ok let's be real:This is a 2014 early access game that was released in 2020. I love it, it's buggy, it's mount and blade, it's love. BU\u03a4:1)Game is buggy, so buggy that you should not only save often, but also in multiple saves cause there are many, many game-breaking bugs that force the player to start over if there's no other way to avoid loopholes.2)Game is not only unfinished, but also feels not properly tested too. Several bugs and missing textures are noticable right from the start while the game is still on rails before moving onto the sandbox gameplay. You just can't miss those things with even bare play testing. To prove my point, i wanted to visit a castle to see how it looks like so i visited Sestadeim. Guess what; Sestadeim castle exterior was EXACTLY the Lycaron City. This is just alpha material.Music is heaven. I believe it's more or less 50% of the games atmosphere.Graphics are gorgeous for a mount and blade game, ok for a 2020 release. Lighting kinda feels weird and fake, but that's just personal opinion. Generaly i'm very pleased.My advice:While it's playable, it's still very far from a steady release. If you're ok with that and you think you have the stamina to re-play the game several times untill it's ready and then some, then get it cause it's freakin awesome. It's mount and blade 2.0. But if you think you'll exhaust all your interest and you'll soon burn out before the game comes into glory, then you maybe should wait for a while and see what happens. I hope as review score now will slowly start to lower after the hype train's gone, taleworlds will continue/start improve their game for the sake of everything.Back into the game:)",

                "text": "The game is still technically in early access, so there are a few things missing like end-game Kingdom functionality and some dialogue options for companions, but overall it's entirely playable in its current state.Coming from Warband, this game is a true successor that improves upon the previous game in several ways. Those who are fans of the previous game will find much that is familiar to them here. Proxies for different Western powers in the land of Calradia, each with their own cultures, strengths, and weaknesses, and the ability to aid or hinder them. There are some quality of life improvements as well, such as the ability to speed up map time by 2x and food not rotting. Towns and castles too feel much more fleshed out, though like in the previous games there is no real need to walk around them and you can avoid doing so the whole game given you never buy a workshop.On top of that, there are some amazing additions, most notably smithing which allows you to custom create weapons how you see fit, and some others like siege weapons. Some aspects of previous games become much more commonplace here, namely tournaments and trade. Now tournaments provide unique items in addition to the gold you bet, and trade is much easier to get involved in and serves an important part of the beginning to mid-game. All in all, much of the game has been smoothed over and polished, retaining much of the older Warband feel while still being an improvement in most areas.Last but not least, the combat. For all the improvements to the base game mentioned above, combat remains one of, if not the largest draw to the series. I have to say, they did a damn fine job at it too. The combat here is so SATISFYING. Warband was fun, and it functions much the same here, but like everything else it has been improved upon. Hits feel a lot meatier as you ride by and cleave someone in twain with a polearm from horseback, duels feel much more tense as weapon handling has been refined, and troop controls have been improved with the ability to select different formations as well as delegate troop command to the AI (sergeants). The battlefields look gorgeous, although with noticeably repeating layouts, and the large scale battles are breathtaking.A pattern is repeated here, where troop commands were present in previous games but not quite as fleshed out or as central as they are here. The only thing I miss is the ability to tell troops to advance or retreat 10 paces, as well as the fact that the AI seems to have much more fine control of the troops than I can possibly manage.All in all, the game is great so far. As a Warband junkie, it feels like much the same game, only *better in almost every way*. The economy feels more involved, game mechanics more polished, and the combat more exhilarating. I can't wait for mods.",

                "text": "I feel like a lot of people here forget what Warband was like or how different Warband was compared to the original Mount & Blade. Warband offered some added functionality, multiplayer, and something of a narrative but was effectively the same game as the original. Even with the Diplomacy mod, the marshal AI was atrocious, marshalling fickle AI lords was even worse, and the limited amount of quests were far more than frustrating. You can't pay me enough to herd zig-zagging cattle to armies, to deliver inconsequential messages across the map, or to fight up and down 80 degree inclines ever again. Even in early-access, Bannerlord is arguably the best medieval simulator on the market, making it more than worth its value at its current price point. The influence system alone is a godsend. No more dedicated marshals and no more soliciting every peer in the realm for votes. Influence controls votes, policies, marshalling, and maintaining army cohesion. I love it. The tactical game is unreal. Gone are the days of Swadian knight charges; the game is now about holding the high ground, giving your archers a line of sight, using your cavalry to harry and flank, and maintaining infantry line discipline, especially in battles with 800+ men. The maps make combat even better. Bridges, cresting hills, narrow valleys, river crossings, rolling sand dunes, and more. Each of these terrain types demand different tactics. Fighting is a lot more fun than in Warband. Two-handed weapons are an art. The animations are satisfying to watch as well. Spear a guy from the front and he flies backwards. Shoot an arrow into a guy's neck and he grasps at it before falling to his knees, dead. Ring a guy with your glaive and he spins around in the direction you struck him. Fantastic. I don't know what all this talk about wasted hours is about. Crashes maybe? I haven't suffered a crash for about 20 hours now. It last happened when I succeeded on the first of two persuasion attempts to marry the Khergit heir. The crash occurred because I opened the dialogue box through the army panel. No big deal. I disbanded the army after I finished a siege, approached the Khergit heir afterwards, and proceeded as planned. We have a kid now and his name is Junjad, but I affectionately refer to him as Junchad. I've only encountered one or two bugs that I couldn't work around, which makes this early-access release more than playable in my eyes.  The only thing I truly dislike about Bannerlord is the defensive siege game. It needs a lot more work. Offensive sieges can be fun though, but they too need some work (e.g. laddered siege towers are useless). I suggest cracking walls with four trebuchets (after racking them up in reserve) for the best experience.Lastly, I find the emergent gameplay qualities to be superb. I've rolled two characters: first with the Battanians and now with the Khuzaits. I've adopted my own roleplay rules (over recruitment, executions, and lofty ambitions) each time and the game enables that. I once got shot off my horse and was about to be swarmed, only to command my cavalry to sweep in and save my life as if I were Jon Snow. Too much fun. I've noticed some women die from childbirth, making lords bachelors again. Feels like a real, breathing world. It'd be nice though if lords and ladies killed each other every once in a while, seeing as they breed like rabbits, but I'm sure that's to come. I've waited a long time for this game and I am beyond happy with it so far. It reminds of me of CK2 back when it was first released \u2014 a great game with the potential to become a masterpiece. Thankfully, TaleWords doesn't make any other games. This is it. With 100+ employees, the potential is there. I wouldn't hesitate to buy as a former Warband player. As a newcomer with different expectations, maybe it's worth waiting for the full release. Up to you if you want to have fun now or later.",

                "text": "so after my first 144 hours in game, I have decided that the early access has a really strong foundation.The graphics are nice, combat is excellent (including horse movement and weapon use), the battles are excellent (including formations and orders), Sieges are much more improved from warband, with the addition of optional siege equipment. The towns feels alive, the factions are interesting and feel different culturally.I like the leveling up system, it feels pretty free, and not too complicated, with some nice benefits to putting time in to skills you are using in a way you enjoy the game anyway. Trading is fun, and a good way to make some cash, though the economy needs work as a whole (talked about below).I prefer the \"Sandbox Mode\" over the \"campaign mode\", as it just plonks you in the world alone, without a main story (much like Warband), though the story is fun the first time (desptire the tediousness of constantly getting repetitive quests)Your family tree, is also amazing. Getting a spouse, having children, watching them grow up, start families for themselves, eventually dying of old age and having your child take over is very immersive.Smithing needs a rework, as its really over/underpowered depending on what you are currently making. Though its necessary due to the below.While I like the Clan system over all, it needs some work mechanically, for instance, allowing lords to join you, despite their clan's intentions. This could work either as the Lord forming a new clan, or they are put in a \"rogue lord\" category until they are back in the same faction as the leader of their clan.. You can't make enough money naturally to achieve any of the necessary goals. Smithing cheese pretty much has to be used to balance the lack of money required for basic mechanics. This ties in to below. The way you end a war is just throwing a random lord $150k gold to stop it. No negotiations or agreements between the leaders of each faction (which is a step back for warband), OR your council can just agree to pay a daily tribute to stop the fighting (again, without agreement from the enemy you are paying tribute too). Also lords can just get auto ransomed, or escape very easily without your say or ability to stop it. This means that during a siege for example, you can defeat a lord, capture them, then have them come back with a new army during the same siege. That is a mess. You should be able to lock people up forever if you so want (or at least only have it so another lord breaks them out, or a tiny chance to escape, based on the security of the settlement).In its current state, the early game is incredible, the mid-game is fun, but the late-game only is really fun if you are a vassal. Having your own kingdom just isn't fleshed out yet.I think the game could be pretty easily perfected by removing the economy aspect from the diplomacy aspect. Not having to bottleneck the game with silver, and instead having diplomacy work on merit and situation alone would improve the game tremendously.edit: spelling mistake",

                "text": "Warband cranked to 11. Not without it's problems, crashes, and broken balance as an early access game, but even with Bannerlord mod-bombed I experience significantly less crashes and issues as of 1.2.0 personally.  TaleWorlds even borrowed some of the most popular mods made for Warband and incorporated them straight into vanilla Bannerlord. Infantry bouncing off shield walls, archers blotting out the sun with volleys of arrows, cavalry charging with spears couched headlong into the breach, and trebuchets reducing castle walls to rubble, all of which in real time with hundreds of units on screen at one time; every unit is a single entity that responds to, reacts to, and fights another unit (or you). Lines will break from morale depletion, attrition will occur if your (or other lords') morale is not managed. Stratagems from any of your favorite sword-and-shield RTS's will translate seamlessly to the battlefield in Bannerlord; it is quite simply an RTS with your own boots on the ground (if you wish, there is also auto-resolve).Player combat is not only refreshing, but frankly fun as hell. Every aspect of combat has been improved upon from Warband, from graphic fidelity to combat mechanics to animations. Although not hyper-realistic, sword-fighting and weaponplay is addictive; you will find yourself chasing looters for days just to s***stomp them for the fun of fighting and the plunder. The UI is being worked on, but there are glaring improvements in all aspects of menu navigation from Warband. Cities, castles and fiefs now have a stylized and more aesthetically pleasing menu card, and notables have portraits at the top of the menu which allow you to teleport straight to them to eliminate manhunting important people to talk to. Troop recruitment is also much more visual and allows you to select specific units, how many units you are buying, displays your current party size, and lets you know when you are over your limit.Fully dynamic world economy with shifting supply and demand that responds directly to not only your trade, but the AI's as well; becoming a medieval capitalist has never been more engaging and rewarding. Flooding a city or region with a certain good will affect it's demand, supply lines can be cut if peasants are intercepted while dropping goods off in cities, caravans can be plundered en route to their destination (yes, even your own), and sieges can block cities from receiving goods; all of which potentially affecting your workshop, caravan and city revenue. Keeping the scope of the world economy in mind, the game world itself is absolutely f***ing massive. There is a ridiculous amount of cities, fiefs, and castles to visit, plunder, or do trade with, all of which operated under the guiding hand of their respective owners. Kingdoms span for miles upon miles, maintaining their borders while wrestling for control with each other; there are PLENTY of kingdoms, all of which moving gold and waging war dynamically with each other constantly. And within these kingdoms, smaller bands of warriors reside; small, fiefless clans wander their territories and can be fought or brought into your eventual kingdom. Even still, bandits and looters scurry from treeline to treeline and along the foothills of mountains to stash their plunder at their (raidable) hideouts. Peasants and caravans make haste for their destinations to keep the gears of the economy grinding. The game world feels alive and organic at all times, a mark plenty of games miss. Maintaining relationships within the realms is important, because as is clear from the above you will be the smallest fish in the pond for a good length of time. There is a much heavier emphasis on relationships now, much more than Warband. Some people won't even talk to you, or will not allow you to accept quests if you are not on good terms with them. The amount of troops you can recruit from notables is also affected by relationships, and they will even deny you troops if you are not on good standings. Fief and city management is much more hands on, as there is plenty to build and improve within them. The management is accompanied by UI elements that help you visualize what you are building and will allow you to mouse over them to reveal what exactly each building does. Siege oriented buildings add depth to castle and city defense, allowing you higher garrisons, more militia, and increased siege build speed. Solid usage-based skill system (think Skyrim) that builds organically through gameplay relevant to applicable skills (ride your horse to level up your riding skill, etc.); no \"dumping points into skills after reaching another level just so you can (eventually) play how you want\" type of progression. You are not Dovahkiin, or some imperative prophet to the balance of the universe. You start exactly as any lowly sword-for-hire would in the Medieval period; with a few weapons relevant to your character's starting skills, horse, the clothes on your back, a small coin purse and no clout whatsoever. People will only know your name once you begin making ripples within the realms of the world or once you begin collecting battle scars; lords will politely state they have no idea who the f*** you are if they have never heard of you.Although official tools unfortunately have not been released to the public just yet, the extensive modding support stitched into the game offers far more than Warband could; TaleWorlds really listened, as the game was built from the ground up to be modded to High Hell. Planned mods in development range from GOT mods to LOTR mods (Warhammer 40k/Fantasy mods please and thank you?). A lot of the true potential for this game lies in the modding support and community; the game is already great out of the box. Everything in the game is value based, which insures you are on the same playing field as other lords within the game, for the most part. For instance with modding, you cannot mod one aspect of the game simply for your own benefit; if you raise the general income of cities with tweaks, AI will reap the benefits just as you will.This game is early access, and many of the systems within the game are planned to be even more fleshed out. More systems are planned to be added into vanilla entirely. There truly is no comparison within the medieval sandbox genre; the size, scale, fun-factor, and sheer addictiveness of this game dwarfs any other title within the genre. This game is one of the few true sandbox experiences on the Steam store and should not be overlooked merely because of the Early Access label.",

                "text": "+Already playable despite Early Access+Fun combat+Decent Graphics+Good foundation in place-Missing some key features from prev games-Not quite polished yetOpen-ended gameplay is where Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord, or any Mount & Blade really, shines the most. You start off with customizing your main character, choosing his background or origins from a multitude of different ways. Did he come from a poor, middle class or noble family? Was he a known troublemaker, good samaritan or just a smart scholar? There are tons of options of customizing your character background, and he also gets his starting skills from these.Aside from the starting quest to get you up and running, the game just tosses you out on the open. What to do next depending on your own, no main quest lines. Be a merchant, trader, mercenary, bandit, lord, soldier, even founding your own kingdom is possible. I haven\u2019t got to it yet but I\u2019ve read that if your character dies, you can choose your heir and that heir will continue the story and be your new character. I wish more games had this neat feature.With everything being bigger than ever; the towns, castles, NPCs, as well as the improved UI, the game feels more like a proper RPG now. I\u2019m getting Witcher 3 vibes from this game especially when roaming around in towns or villages riding a horse. Unlike a lot of sequels that try hard to change the formula or revolutionize the series only to fail, Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord does quite the opposite and perfectly embodies the proverb mentioned above. It religiously follows the blueprint for what constitutes a Mount & Blade game, which is a great thing.For all intents and purposes, Bannerlord is basically just a remastered Mount & Blade: Warband just with a new expansion providing the new features. And this was just exactly what the people wanted. Even Bannerlord in very low graphics looks very close visually to Warband. That being said, I will try to review it as its own game with only minimal comparison to Warband. The graphics are decent. It surprised me how a game that was at one point planned for a 2016 release still comes with visuals that is passable for today's (2020) standards. Props for the effort to upgrade the graphics throughout the years. Granted it isn't the best looking game I've seen. Still, the game is an epic battle moment screenshot goldmine. I wish they could include Ansel support in the future. There are lots of weapons in Bannerlord: Bows, Crossbows, Spears, Maces, Axes, Swords, Shields of all types, and many more. There is also a weapon crafting system, a new addition to the series. Besides traditional foot combat, horseback combat is also available and a huge part of the game. There are different theatres for warfare present throughout: An open area of various terrains from dense forests, rugged hills, watery riverside, to huge open fields. Or through the different villages or castles in the world map, should you attack or defend them.Combat is fun, as expected for the series. Indeed one of the strongest points of the game. Swinging your weapon, blocking and parrying attacks, hitting and killing enemies all feels very gratifying. The AI is harder now and that\u2019s a good thing. Compared to Warband\u2019s buttery smooth combat and animations, Bannerlord\u2019s take is much more gritty and realistic. Swings and animations have more weight to it. Weapons have far larger differences now in terms of speed and reach. They react more realistically when hitting objects. Unfortunately this results in huge balance issues for the game that they need to sort out. The game maxes out at 1000 units, meaning you can have 500 vs 500 battles which is a huge amount of NPCs fighting. It really feels immersive going into battle and gives me that Lord of the Rings vibes. (can\u2019t wait to play LOTR mods in the future!)One major key feature that I\u2019ve found missing is the auto-block option for at least the singleplayer. This was actually the default option for the previous games so naturally a lot of old timers are requesting it back. For now, all players are stuck with the competitive style directional blocking. This makes non-shield type melee combat inaccessible for a huge amount of players. At the same time this makes shield or ranged combat the unquestionable superior types of combat.In my opinion, Bannerlord really needs the early access treatment, for better or for worse. With the first game being one of the first titles to go on early access before it was even called early access, having the second game follow a similar direction is just fitting. For a game with such scope and ambition, it is more effective to tap into the playerbase; old and newcomers alike, before going on full release. Thousands of players playtesting the game is much better than having an internal or limited access playtesting only. Sure, they could have gone instead with a free beta access and offered a pre-order option only for those willing to pay. But it\u2019s basically just Early Access in the grand scheme of things.Despite being in an already playable state, the game still needs a lot of work. Especially in the singleplayer campaign. Questlines are unfinished and lacking in content, textures missing, and maps being reused. Some features are to follow or a work in progress. Should you play this game right now, prepare to find a lot of placeholder text for basically everything. Warband actually feels more like a better and solid game right now when it comes to these aspects.The game ran passably on my setup: i7-8700k, 32GB RAM, and GTX 1080. Hovers just around 50-60 with everything maxed out and testing a 500 vs 500 NPC battle. It\u2019s a CPU heavy game so no matter the resolution or graphics settings it still plateaus at around 50-60 FPS when the game gets very demanding. As a high refresh rate user, it\u2019s a bit disappointing. But this is one of the rare cases where I would trade my precious 100+ FPS for 50+ FPS just to experience huge epic battles. I've only encountered one graphical bug so far. During battle, some parts of the screen bugged and turned into black squares. I couldn't see 80% of what's happening. I reloaded my save and so far it never came back. Despite all the current issues, it\u2019s still a yes for me. Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord already has all the hallmarks of a future great open-ended sandbox game. The foundation is already in place, it just needs that extra time in early access to tie up all the loose ends. If you want a fully polished solid experience at your first playthrough, I would suggest waiting it out. Either by still buying it now at a discounted price to encourage and support the devs, or by playing it safe by waiting for the final release before deciding to vote with your money.\"This product was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free\"",

                "text": "If you're deciding whether you should wait to buy the game, or go for it now it all comes down to how much perfection you expect from a game in early access.All issues I have experienced are minor, there have been no crashes, or major gameplay issues. All issues seem to be visual, with the graphics not looking as good as the videos and promotional pictures, but still overall pretty good. Minor other issues, such as starting battles in first person and seeing the backs of your eyes/eyebrows are the greatest problems I've encountered. Those are solved by switching from first to third, then back to first person so it's not the end of the world by any stretch of the imagination. If minor graphical issues are a dealbreaker for you, save your money until a few updates come out and maybe invest it in some chill pills in the meantime. If you're okay with a game that's perfectly playable, though a little rough around the edges, you won't regret buying the game. Overall Bannerlord is a massive improvement over the originals and I'm very happy with my purchase.",

                "text": "1100 hours in annnd...The game is fun, no doubt about it, but for the most part it's a prettier Warband.  Without mods the game is pretty barebones in content.  The game is not hard.  Once you've hit lvl 30+ a few times you can steamroll the game.  If you are going to make you own kingdom, in order to recruit other lords you will have to chase them down to give gifts or release them after battle to get your rep with them high to recruit them.If you have multiple towns the rep notifications from the Governor with the merchants of the town is non-stop.  Each notification has a sound.  In my current playthrough I get so many that they actually queue and lag behind.With the Perk system, some are useful.  Overall most are worthless.  This is due to the fact that each perk has a role.  Like, Personal, Captain, Governor, Party Leader.  Governor perks are worthless to player.  Players can't be governors.  Others are role specific Surgeon, Scout, Engineer, Quartermaster.Companions are essentially non developmental.  Scouts will increase their Scout skill.  Surgeons just stop at 160ish.  Engineers won't go higher than 100ish.  They learn other skills at an abysmal rate therefore they barely level.  Maybe 2 levels if you're lucky.Sieges are plagued by the AI and player controlled soldiers not using ladders, siege towers and engines in a reasonable fashion.  If there are 2 ladders to one side to scale a wall, only one will be used.  Some siege towers have 3 ladders.  Typically 1 is used normally but you might see 2 every so often.  Very rarely 3.Now what I consider to be the absolute best part of the game.  You will spend 90% of your time on the campaign map.  Moving around fight, recruit, siege, defend, etc.  You will do this all at a whopping 6-12 frames per second.  The menus load slowly.  The last 3 to 4 patches have dramatically reduced the campaign map performance to a level that is 1 more headache away from never playing again.  Battles are just fine and have normal FPS.  Taleworlds is indicating this might, could possible be a bug and have no ETA on a fix or if there will be a fix.  With release happening this year.The very fundamental basics of a good game are there.  Taleworlds just hasn't done anything with them.  They also haven't appeared to want to do anything with them either.  Rumor is they've moved on to another game or are working on DLC leaving this one to wallow in the depths of slow development.Would I recommend this game?  If you like M&B and have the cash then have at it.  If you're on the fence, buy Warband instead.",

                "text": "In this game I became the Medieval Military Industrial Complex.Orestes was a simple man,After his village was raided by bandits, he took it upon himself to form a small caravan. He went from Lageta to Ortysia to Sargot and back trading commodities such as horses, wine, grapes the like. One day his humble caravan was beset by looters. This battle awoke a bloodlust in Orestes that he could not control.Looking south Orestes invaded the lands of the sand people and defeated a small army. Its general by chance, the very Sultan of the sand people was taken to Orestes, who had him decapitated. There would be no quarter to the barbarian pagans of the deserts. What ensued was an absolute bloodbath, over 30 nobles slain in guerrilla warfare, scorched earth tactics. Towns all over surrendered their meager #3 quantities of cheese and butter, and also their hobbled weapons and tools. The campaign would soon deplete Orestes saved up fortune and he was forced to turn back to Ortysia. There he discovered his new passion as a salesman of the finest boots and headwraps. But this was not enough, curious one day Orestes visited his local smith and forged his first sword. In the span of a few weeks Orestes would forge so many weapons as to rival Hephaestus himself. His swords soon sky rocketed in value and he was able to bankrupt the entire city's economy with the sale of a single one of his Signature Two-Handed Polearms, titled: Mars.Orestes would then take up arms again. This time acquiring the Dragon Banner of Calradia and claiming rightful fief of all of Calradia. Barbarians would no longer sate his blood lust. At the sight of the first castle, Garonter, Orestes would besiege with a force of 100 veterans against the castle's 230 garrison. It took him 3 weeks to build his siege engines and in 3 weeks he was beset daily by the Empire's best men, even their emperor Garios. All would fall to Orestes with the clairvoyant power of the F5 quicksave. His kill count would rise each battle, until night before the siege, Orestes himself killed over 100 men in single combat after the garrisoned had sallied forth from their gates. It would be after this that Orestes made peace with the Empire, went back to Ortysia and crafted 30 divinely infused and crafted polearms, each worth 40k and donated them to the towns under his fief. Within 3 weeks he was churning a profit that fuel his further expansion into Thoracte Castle, Tubulis Castle, Sargot, Quyaz and now Ortysia itself.Now Orestes raids the wastelands of the desert, slaying man and woman alike. His nations economy runs on him conquering the Saracen heathens. Smelting down their impoverished weapons to craft ones divinely inspired by God himself, then selling these majestic pole-arms and the fallen solider's boots back to his people, who then sell those at even more inflated rates back to foreign nobles travelling through town.",

I know that's a strange predicament for someone with 265 hours on record at time of this review, but let me explain;This game is great, there is a lot to it and the files can be edited to make the game align more to your taste.However, the AI is bad.And I mean BAD.On campaign, I've joined an army which gathered at a village which was very close to a friendly castle which was being besieged. Our army was larger than the besieging force, but the army leader decided to ignore that and head North to almost the other side of the map to raid a village.In battle, the army I was in advanced toward a Battanian army which positioned itself quite cleverly at the top of a steep hill. Our army stopped and stood at the bottom just taking ranged attacks, they finally walked half way up the hill, but then turned around, presented their BACKS to the ranged enemy and walked back down. They did this about 4 times before finally charging up the hill. The battle was won, but there were so many avoidable casualties taken.In siege, the AI doesn't understand ladders. when they lift the siege ladders, they only use one of the two if they use them at all. Sometimes they just stand at the base of the ladders and do nothing. The AI is slightly better with Siege towers, though with laddered siege towers, the defenders have a habit of climbing down the ladders and literally start fighting on them, until one of the attacking artillery pieces destroys its own siege tower.These are just single experiences I've had from an absolute ton of them, but I will still recommend this game, there is still so much on offer, and it's early access, so there is still time for these AI problems to be addressed.",

Huge respect to the devs for actually listening to the community. It's a good time to get it.PAST REVIEW8 long years and this is what we get. It's not really a huge leap when compared to its predecessor. In terms of graphical fidelity sure but veteran warband players will still experience more of the same thing and much of the dialogue is a copypaste from the previous title. Speaking of voice acting, there is hardly any. While the architecture is now more grand and detailed, players will still have no reason to explore different parts of a city and fast travelling can be done via TAB menu. There are tons of things that are completely incoherent to the setting. The villages as described by the game to be rich and flourishing are empty. In fact, it doesn't matter how prosperous it is, you will still see the same farmers working the fields. They should add more villagers each with their own things to say to make the environment believable. Castles have few guards without any noble residing in it In character customization, you can't select presets. You can't sculpt your character's face according to race/faction. The quests from the previous title are petty chores and they're imported into this game as well. New merchant quests in particular are non-sensical and pointless. I'm sure a lot of players would appreciate if the devs could create a more story driven campaign with voice acting in addition to its already solid sandbox foundation. Court advisors and viziers should be the intermediary during dialogue to show that a king isn't simply some peasant you can talk to. An audience granted by a king or sultan must be sought, earned and being in their presence should be an honour. Being knighted and swearing allegiance to them, a prestigious moment to elevate a sense of purpose for the player. Even more so to imagine what it would be like for the player to be sitting on that very throne. Medieval nobility here are puppets to be exploited. Instead why not give them their own unique personalities with their actions and yours affecting political climate and change of attitude among them. NPCs are just programmed to war with each other with no proper implementation of diplomacy. If the player eventually rules a faction, why can't the ruler send an emissary to a neighboring kingdom to open up favorable diplomatic options. Why would there be a feature to dress casually if it didn't affect your status or charm. There should be different and interesting dialogue options when speaking to NPCs. Female players should be able to curtsy and dance in accordance to the faction's culture. What's a medieval age without upheavals? There should be demagogue usurpers from a starving populace hellbent on overthrowing a crazy monarch. These are examples of how you add depth to a sandbox game. Despite all this, I can still recommend it to players who have never played mount and blade. This is simply an upgraded version of the previous title with a simple economic system, political system based on influence, tournaments and the new blacksmithing feature. The battles are still epic as ever with a plethora of medieval weapons, armor, accessories and horses for yourself and your companions. As for me, I'm going to wait for for the devs to actually make use of the financial support they're getting and release a major update worth playing.",

Some things need to be fully added, some things just aren't functional. The reputation system is not perfect yet, as it's very hard to gain rep with others, but very easy to lose it. But the economy is super fleshed out. I started as a merchant to get myself going and could easily see how my efforts were effecting cities I traded in, their prosperity, and thus mine as eventually I owned workshops and saw them flourish as I made sure they had the necessary items to produce goods. As far as performance goes, I don't really have much to complain about.. It runs fine on my machine and only super-massive battles do I see frame drops in the start.. Sometimes it does crash, but I'm used to frequently hitting that F5 button (quicksave) so even if I do, it's only a few minutes lost.. I have sort of seen the \"snowball\" people talk about, but in my experience each time it happens, the faction eventually crumbles.. There are a lot of NPCs and they certainly flock to strong factions. I think it will be more manageable in my subsequent playthrough now that I know a lot more.. All in all, this is shaping up to be just as legendary as the original. I didn't expect a perfect game from the start, but am still impressed about what is in the game and functioning now. There are many things that are clearly placeholders and things you can see have a presence but not fully functional... That is fine with me.. It is now Friday - the game came out Monday.. so in 4 days I have 75 hours played.. And I am not a \"fanboy\" by any means and wouldn't blindly praise something just because... In fact the original game I played more of the GoT mod than the regular game. But for $40, I have already surpassed my criteria ($1 per hour) of getting a good game with value. I am sure I will have a decent amount more as I finish up my campaign and maybe another soon.. But I also know that when the game is fully released, I will double my time again to experience the full force.",

I commanded armys to raid castles in bloody, close, combat battles and when I win I can't help but to feel like a badass. Just the title screen and music do it for me. for that reason I overlook the flaws. This game is jam packed with stuff but often feels repetitive. The story isn't the greatest, but the game litterally drops you in and you basically conquer the world the way you want. Be a warlord or a merchant, side with person A or person B, you have options.

(sourcing themselves: . How come? Game is far from finished and absolute snail\u2019s pace of development will for granted not finish it in a few months, when this game has been going on for years and since they launched it on steam on early access prepurchase, they have mostly been doing minor fixes and balancing. No new features, quests or dialogues since I last played to this dayGame is enjoyable early on. I like that there's a main quest that adds special events to the gameplay (unlike in Warband), but there's only one and its pretty straight forward, on every new game you do... combat feels good, but besides that, talking to a lord is always pointless unless he has a task for you (no options whatsoever), sieges get (like in Warband) to be repetitive, but here, there's bugs that make sieges way more difficult than it should be. Fief options are very limited. Marrying has little use besides getting a free companion, selecting a bride for your brother is literally useless.This game as of December 2021 feels okeish but still a shell, unfinished product, and if you watch the pace at which they've been adding patches and specially, at the scarce amount of contents within these patches, you already know this game will not be finished for June 2022. At least, I hope they allow mods to fix all the stuff that was meant to be fixed already when game releases, but it still feels wrong for a 50\u20ac game which has been 2 years in Early Access and many more on development.",

                "text": "I would first recommend this game to the players who are more open world / medieval combat oriented. Games like Mordhau, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Chivalry etc.. are the reasons I fall into this category, and if you like any of those games or any similar to that. You will already like Bannerlord before you realize it. But to those who aren't familiar with M&B, a half decent summary would say it is a medieval sandbox where your goal is to be the strongest faction on the map by whatever means necessary.   TO THOSE WHO PLAYED M&B WARBAND:Many would consider this to be a continuation of this game, and I'd have to agree. It is not a bad thing because I believe there is a lot more content being added and a lot of problems that have been solved since then. Combat mechanics are the same, with some ai differences and new weapons/armor. New perk trees/concepts for you and your companions. Bannerlord also added a questline that nudges you along towards total domination, either by you or your ruler. Oh and also, when you feel like skipping the battle and just sending your troops in, they fixed the chance system for how likely characters are to die. So rest assured you don't have to worry about one sea raider killing multiple of your hundreds of troops What I found to be the strongest points that make this game shine:-A free roam concept where you do as you please. You can serve/fight for whatever faction you wish, including your own. You can interact with characters  and so on.-You are able to participate in open battles with hundreds of units on the field, commanding different types of troops to do different actions(face a certain direction, make a formation, hold fire, follow you) and many others, or if you're a part of an army filled with other nobles, then you lead one type of troop (infantry, arrows, cavalry, horse archers) under your commander. Regardless you are going to take a step back when you first see dozens of cavalry rolling over the hills in the distance, or when your commander gives the order to charge and you have to join the front line where chaos is the only thing that is happening. -Siege events with a lot of potential for strategy, I say potential because if you decide not to set them on auto the troops are only as effective as you are at commanding them, but as far as content there is a lot going on. Between manning a catapult to try and take out their siege tower, and making sure that the troops are holding the line at the main gate where they've broken through. It takes a lot out of your hands as you try to make it all happen on the keyboard. and it looks really intimidating seeing hundreds moving troops outside your walls. -very smooth trading system in markets and with npc's (it's still in EA so frame rate drops, load screens still happen but that is something that will be smoothed out) -music music music, I love the MUSIC! Consistently M&B proves that not all gaming companies are giving up on going above and beyond for their soundtracks. The only negatives I have for this one is that there isn't enough of it and I wasn't there in person to hear it being performed. Sadly I found some things to be negative points about the game. This is kind of difficult to tell since it is in EA, so things may be added/changed/fixed after this post so I will focus on content that is there now rather than bugs and whatnot. -AI isn't the smartest, if you're not the commander and you are only in charge of one troop. Then they go on to do whatever they want to, and it may not match up with what is considered the best strategy. At the beginning of each battle you spawn on opposite sides of the map. One battle my commander thought it best to go backwards and to the left up a hill with a bunch of trees. Pushing the boundary of the map, I had to figure out where I was going to put 200+ archers so that they could see and fire at the enemy. -You only know as much as you research. What I mean by this is that the only tutorial you get is the combat and how to use different weapons/shields. Arguably this isn't a negative, but I deem it more negative than not because there are a few menu/keyboard tips that would help to know early on. As silly as it sounds, I spent more time than I should have looking in the vendors inventory for food because I didn't know that the category filters were at the top of the screen. Or how I wanted to look characters/locations up to know what faction they were a part of, or to find them but couldn't until I accidentally pressed n and opened the encyclopedia. They have already added a mechanic that lets you click rmb to open the encyclopedia on a certain items but that doesn't solve the entire issue of the average player being clueless. Right now when you press esc in game there is a list of tips you can look through on the left which is a plus, but I hope they add more because it doesn't solve as many questions as it could. All in all the game is great and any of the negatives I've found don't outweigh the positives. If you were sold on the game after a few points then you're going to love it regardless of whatever you dislike about the game. I bought it not only because it appeals to what I like in a game, but also because I believe TaleWorlds is capable of reminding players what their standards should be for a great game. Anyways I hope this helps!",

They are sidelining the community at every opportunity. They have a track record of hindering any and all attempts of their modding community at fixing their broken game and have shown actual jealousy over the work of their modding scene.Almost two years ago TW proclaimed that custom, moddable servers can't be made now, but they'll be a thing in 2022, which prompted the modding community to making their own custom servers in few days of work, all by adding few lines of code. TW of course threw a hissy fit over it and patched it out, but it at least shown us how incompetent they are at their own jobs.\"It's early access, you have to lower your expectations\" - My expectations are so low that I had to dig a hole for them to lay in.This game should have never been released in Early Access. You need tons of mods to make it actually feel alive and fun, something which TW is actively hindering by throwing tantrums at all Total Conversion modders, because once again - players can do a better job than the actual devs.This whole development process is a farce from start to finish. I honestly hope that when they (maybe) eventually release their 1.6, they'll adress all these issues and stop sidelining players with corpo-talk and tantrums. But it's TaleWorlds, so the reality is that they're probably limiting our possibilities to milk us on future in-game-transactions and mediocre DLCs.I wish we got the same treatment Warband did with Viking Conquest, which was a joined project of both the developers and the community.Forums topics I'm referring to in the review are 'An open letter from the Kingdoms of Arda team, and the total-conversion mod community' and 'Multiplayer mods can't be made until 2022 unless we find an alternative', but there are literal hundreds other posts and topics there that show how out of touch and jaded the devs are. I will be posting links to the topics mentioned above below (assuming steam won't delete them)and",

                "text": "A worthy successor to Warband, but it still needs more time in the oven. Mods fix some of the bigger issues. I'd rank it as a must-play if you were a WB fan or if you've ever wanted to play a Total War game as a 3rd person RPG of sorts.Pros:+ Looks good. Many times, even better than the screenshots on the Steam store.+ Moddable.+ Gorgeous soundtrack.+ The core gameplay loop is awesome. It feels good to go from zero to hero. You eventually find a favorite weapon that suits your play style and smithing can let you obtain an even better version of it.+ Battles no longer end when you die, and you can fast-forward the remainder of the battle, which is very nice.+ A lot of the crashes that made the game almost unplayable near release have been fixed. In 1.6.2 I got about one crash every 3-4 hours, and that's while running 10+ mods, which is pretty good in my book - just save often.Cons:- The first and biggest issue is the way experience works. Because new levels ask for exponential increases in skill levels while decreasing your learning rate, reaching mastery in any skill takes an incredible amount of time. I get that, realistically, you could only hope to master one, maybe two things during a lifetime, and the game wants to lean towards realism. I just wish the game also offered you the choice between realistic and \"power fantasy\" when it comes to skill leveling, because the game is a lot more fun when you can personally take out 30-50 enemies before formation combat even begins.As of 1.6.2, you can address this by using the Leveling Rebalance mod, possibly in combination with the Kaoses tweaks mod. Unfortunately, mods frequently break during new updates, so this will be a recurring issue.- Endgame kingdom management should have some auto-resolve options, such as \"give fief to noble with most council support / highest relation / lowest relation\".- There should be a way to contact lords without having to find them on the other side of the map. Couriers and emissaries would be a way. You should also be able to talk with them while they're in jail, at least if it's your jail.- The AI could use improvements. Riders still frequently crash into trees, ladders are sometimes ignored during sieges, cavalry attached to infantry formations will ride ahead to their death instead of staying close. Archers in the same formation will prefer forming one vulnerable long line, unflinching even when clearly being overrun by cavalry/infantry, instead of splitting up and moving around during AI control - which I imagine is a limitation of the formations system - but I wish the AI itself could handle smarter splitting of troops. Enemies will constantly stream at you when respawning instead of trying to regroup and have a sizable force for a new wave, though your troops are guilty of doing the same. Also, during sieges, one unit will sometimes get stuck and you can't end the battle without exiting the map and restarting it.Still, it is generally competent enough to make the gameplay fun, I just feel like it's a few steps away from being truly great. I hope to one day come back to it and replay it as an RTS where I dodge the occasional arrow, with troop command being a fully viable play style.Overall rating: 8 out of 10 Swadian butter caravans. Some changes to the way you gain experience and how the AI handles itself, as well as further improving on game stability would bring it over the finish line, and all of these seem doable with time.",

                "text": "TL;DRFor any fan of the Mount & Blade series, Bannerlord is an easy choice:  Yes, get it!  It's worth the price even in Early Access.  I've played Bannerlord from day one and can honestly say the current game has drastically improved since the public release.Essentially, the player starts as a skill-less, worthless, unknown peasant and begins earning his/her salt by fighting up through the ranks.  Exactly what you do is your choice:  Become the right-hand man of a King/Queen or develop your own kingdom.  Stay independent and deal in trade as a merchant.  Rogue it up by ransacking villages, traveling civilians and caravans.  Be honorable or a miscreant.  There's no linear path but choices have consequences, good and bad.The start can be rough and a bit of a grind, but once you've saved enough money to hire some troops, purchased a few shops, hired some caravans and made some noble friends, then the game really takes off.Key highlights:Pros+ Open World, Sandbox+ Combat is mostly fluid and satisfying.  Certainly not a combat simulator, but requires just enough 'skill' to be more than a simple button-smasher.+ First person perspective combat; and 3rd person for you weirdos out there :P + No specified roles.  Fight on foot or horse.  Fight with sword, ax, pole-arm, bow & arrow, etc.  Heavy armor, light armor or no armor?  Shield or no shield - that is the question!+ Progression.  There is a noticeable difference in combat as your character improves as well as your \"companions\" (NPC's whom follow the player).+ Skill Tree.  A wide variety of skills that definitely impact game play.  + Inventory Management. BIG improvement over previous titles. + Family system.  Can marry and have children.  Children become heirs so the player can continue playing once the original character dies from old age.+ Companions.  Various NPCs have unique skills.  Use them to your advantage (warrior, trader, engineer, surgeon and more).+ Town & Castle Management.  Can build improvements to fiefs that impact security, garrison, income, growth and a few others.  Pretty basic.  Improved over previous titles but needs love.  See Neutral for more info. + Gangs.  Every town has a gang that may or may not own a shop.  Can clear them out of towns (temporarily) to gain favor of from merchants or other gang leaders.  Impacts your reputation and relationships.  I believe future updates will incorporate more uses for them.+ Shops.  Can purchase shops in town as an easy way to earn extra money.  Read a guide on how they work.  Not much to them but some things aren't apparent.+ Graphics are nice.  Nothing next-gen but still eye pleasing.+ Developers - they continuously add updates and meaningful changes.  Yes, there have been a few broken patches, but it doesn't take long before they're corrected.+ Hundreds and hundreds of hours of game play.  I'm not even sure if there is an \"end\" unless the character dies with no heirs?Neutral-+ Story-line - it's just 'Meh'.  Regardless, it has been improved and expanded.-+ Equipment (weapons, armor, etc.)  There is already an impressive amount of gear, but I do hope they add more, especially for armors and cosmetics (civilian clothing).-+ Town/Castle Management.  Simply needs more depth and complexity - a bit too basic as is but not enough to warrant a \"con\".Cons- Hit registry.  Usually good, but will definitely experience instances when the player's weapon passes through enemy with no damage.  - AI.  Friendly AI love to block your attack, your path and overall be a nuisance.  Common to have nearby friendlies block your attack on enemy, while enemy AI happily ignore the shields of friendly AI.  It's just aggravating and weird.- AI pathing.  Has been improved but still an issue.  AI don't always climb ladders or siege towers, but rather stand at the bottom while arrows rain down from above.  Perhaps they drank too much mead before battle?  (Helpful tip:  sometimes the problem is one moron blocking the ladder.  An arrow to this guy's face may unscrew the screw up.)- Lighting.  Some objects, like plants/bushes and rocks, bleed light (casts a glow around or under them).  Some flickering issues in certain areas.  When characters or horses run, they kick up large clouds of dust and it's very reflective.  All minor issues.- PC requirements.  You'll want a fairly beefy system to enjoy large battles and high graphics but a mid-range setup and lowered settings can play adequately.  My settings & PC setup @ end.Areas to Improve:- Hit registry needs love.  It's not horrible, but can be very aggravating at times during critical moments.- Barter screen.  The slider scale is too sensitive when trying to adjust large amounts of items or currency.  Also, the mouse delay for holding left-click is way too long before items increase or decrease.- Some areas in towns or battles have light flickering or light bleed (under rocks/plants) during certain times of day.Playing at 2560x1440 on mostly high settings, averaging 100-120 frames during battles.9900K @ 5.2 Ghz32 GB DDR4 @ 3200 MHz (CL 14)2070 Super (OC)Installed on SSD",

While there is certainly a case to be made for that, I think any potential buyer of this game needs to be aware of the current state (as of March 30th 2021) of the game.The skeleton of the proposed game experience is in place. You can run around a map fighting looters and armies, or you can join a kingdom and do so, but that's pretty much it in terms of things that are working as they should. There is a lot of big fixes that still need to come after quite some time of being in beta. This has left the current game community rather frustrated as the devs keep making small fixes for minor issues no-one seemingly asked for, and all but ignore big long-standing issues (i.e. siege AI) that people have practically begged for. The devs have also alienated all of the major players in the modding community (which is what is currently keeping the game alive) by ignoring their pleas for better communication on up-coming fixes and not listening to their suggested (simple) fixes for alot of the larger issues plaguing the game. This resulted in said modders creating a open letter to the devs voicing their displeasure with the current state of the game and the devs communication, and announcing their abstaining from modding till improvement in these areas.Will you get a couple hours of fun out of the game as it stands? Yes, but you need to note that the game is very bare bones currently and that modding is going to be constant process of updating and reinstalling as the game updates and breaks all mods and you previous save-game compatibility. Is it worth the listed price? For what it currently offers, absolutely not, get it on sale if you must, or wait till final release. As a long standing fan of the franchise I'm left with a pretty sour taste in my mouth but I'll continue to check in and remain hopeful that future fixes make the game more playable and enjoyable.",

I bought the game on launch, and honestly I was pretty unimpressed and decided I'd wait a while then come back to see how things were going. With that out of the way, here's some of my thoughts on where it's at right now:I cannot recommend anyone to buy this game in good conscious unless you genuinely don't care about value for money. The game is still M&B, if you loved Warband, you will enjoy this game. The problem is that there's nothing at all beneath the surface gameplay. The choices you make and the people you befriend or make enemies of simply do not matter at all. The game outside of combat feels extremely lifeless. Every NPC says the same 2 or 3 lines. Your dialogue choices don't actually matter either. Companions have less depth than Warband, and spouses might as well just be your acquaintance that occasionally carries your child. Towns and villages are absolutely dead as well. Taverns are especially funny, with musicians consistently playing invisible lutes and maidens pouring ale until the end of time. Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is obviously the major selling point, but at $50 I was hoping for a world that's at least more interactive than Warband's, not somehow less.The AI is incredibly easy to manipulate and often quite stupid. You can stop any siege in it's tracks by starting a siege on something of theirs close by. There's almost no semblance of actual strategy for your allies or enemies in battles as well. 99% of large battles have one or both sides forming an infantry circle around their archers and letting the cavalry fight among themselves. You haven't experienced true hell until you get knocked out in the arena and all that's left is two horse archers circling each other for 20 minutes, missing every single arrow until they finally have to pull out their swords. That's not to say the combat isn't fun, but it's certainly not polished at all.My final reason for not recommending this game comes when you look at the patch notes. It's all crash fixes. There's some new singleplayer content, some future plans. That's all well and good, but scroll through all the patch notes, and 90% of them are fixing crashes that seemingly occur for every interaction in the game. I'm not implying they shouldn't be fixing crashes, but rather pointing out a worrying trend. This game has been in development hell since it's announcement, and I doubt it's coming out of early access any time soon. I want to see this title and TW reach their full potential so badly, but I'm also a realist. This game still has YEARS to go before I'd wager I'll be able to proudly proclaim \"this product is worth $50 USD +tax\". I will be ecstatic the day I can come back to this review and update it, but for now it's a no from me.",

                "text": "When you purchase a product, you do not expect to get banned from multiplayer for violating chinese censorship rules. This includes having the \"incorrect\" steam ID. This affects accessibility of a game feature and hence is a relevant buy consideration.TW has made some claims to invistigate it, but so far without any further results. TW mods here on steam forums have just purged a thread (instead of at least locking it with a comment why) which called for attention regarding this censorship. Note also, the discussion there was surprisingly calm without getting overboard. I am glad to remove/change the review when this issue is settled the only possible correct way.*update 03.11.2021*Since this review, the only thing about it I can find is claim by TW that they are going to investigate it, but no further updates since, even if I employ a search on that topic again. I find stale \"updates\" like this one: Regarding the game itself:The skill leveling system is a pure grind. For some very annoying skills there is a cheese workaround in some way which is totally unimmersive, like for example to train roguary fast, you need to stage prison escapes for others over and over again. People you don't care about and don't know. Just to get the XP... Most ways of doing XP gives no xp. You can also not train fighting skills in tournaments and arena, because its reduced to almost zero. TW thinks there is only one way to play the game - as a vassal or soldier of another kingdom. Complete breakage compared to warband. Then there are skills like smithing, which are tedious and boring, the UI is terrible, but: you can craft items for the cheapest resources worth around 200 gold and sell them for around 90.000 gold at very low levels which you get to very fast.You go trade with a noble one, sell him 5 swords for all the fortune he owns and they are happy to sign the deal. Then they are in dire need of money and sell all their land for gold worth selling 9 swords...If you think its a bug, no. Its like that since the beginning and its not just one specific item. The prices for items are crazy. One sword costs 5k, another one has 1 more damage and consts 30k or 50k.With smithing you basically have infinite money EASY and FAST. You can buy all the realm and the nobles will happily sell it to you. No army needed, Just craft some ~60-90 weapons!I have no clue what the devs took to make that real and keep it like that with no changes.",

I got teary over the past weekend playing this at a convention, I get emotional writing this review, because this game is not just a high quality PC port, it is an amazing port of my childhood, my memories.The game plays like Tekken, in every way that is a good thing. The game looks like Tekken, only prettier than ever before. This game feels like Teken, and honestly, there is very little that I as a gamer appreciate more than a game genuinely crafted with passion that captures a memory.  A game that allows me to relive some of the happiest moments of my life and make for great new stories.If you do not have this yet, I highly recommend you get this soon as you can.",

Some could argue that the story mode is the tutorial, but that's unacceptable. The story mode misses out a huge portion of mechanics hidden within the game, such as all of your recovery options when you're slammed onto the ground.The only real way to learn how to play Tekken 7, outside of learning by yourself through practice mode or online matches, is to research tutorials and mechanics online.",

                "text": "+ Tekken finally has a PC-port and it's fantastic! The entire version is objectively the best with fantastic graphics, short load-times and tons of peripheral support. This is a perfect example of a series transitioning to PC! If you like fighting-games, this is an absolute must-buy!+Fantastic mechanics that are fun for allTekken has a low barrier to entry, but a massive skill-ceiling. You can buy this game and have a fantastic time even if you have never played a fighting game before. For the serious player the game features insane depth and a lot to enjoy. Tekken 7 has changed things such as throw-breaking and made things generally more streamlined, but maintained it's complexety and depth. This really is the best Tekken has ever been. +Optimized rosterWhile not perfect, the roster is tightened up. Your favorite is most likely still in the game and the newcomers are generally good. Each character feels unique and I feel Namco has made good decisions on which characters to keep.+Hype as \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 final bossJust play the story and see for yourself.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lack of content in generalI would like to underline that this game has already been out for 2 years in arcades. While not the FR-version, the game has techinally been complete. This begs the question of what in the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Namco has been doing for 2 years. Customization is a joke compared to Tekken 6 and there are very few modes. There is also no replay-mode or anything outside the basic ranked online.The story-mode is very short and the scenarios for other characters are just abysmal. These scenarios are basically a random fight with an in-engine cutcene that does the bare minimum of fan-service. Every Tekken-game before this has had far more fleshed out content story-wise in general. Also, the customization is especially sadening considering that there are so few characters and one would assume this means more options for each one. -Mediocre story-modeThe story-mode is short and nothing to really brag about. It has some cool moments (and Akuma), but it's basically a bunch of CG-cutcenes tied together with a terrible narrator and a hamfisted plot. The story makes no sense, but I can't really fault the game for it. Tekken has always been bonkers. However, compared to many other fighters it really falls flat and it has to be pointed out considering that the game offers very little other content.-No tutorials or help for newcomersThe game has absolutely no tutorial and it's honestly baffling. Tekken is not an easy game to get into. Sure you can mash buttons as Eddy, but there is only a question of time until someone bodies you. It's easy to feel lost in this game, yet the game makes very little effort to teach you anything. You are going to end up on YouTube and other sites to figure out combos, frame-data etc. and that isn't good. There should at least be something here to teach new players the basics.-Online has flawsAs of writing this there are several big problems with online that will hopefully be fixed soon. First of all, rage-quitting is a SERIOUS problem. There is basically no punishment for quitting and if a player disconnects on you, you don't get the win. This becomes an even bigger problem in Tekkens tournament-mode. If the host gets mad he can kick you immediately or outright leave to shut down the entire lobby. As a result, playing Tournament-mode is rather difficult.Connecting to other players is also very difficult as of right now. Connecting through the match-list is almost hopeless and filled with error messages. The best option is using warm-up and wait for a match to be suggested by the matchmaking system. However, this is also frustratingly difficult. It can take 3-4 requests before you can accept a request to fight that actually works. As a result you will often end up in games with 3-bar connections because the game has not been able to connect to the players that fit the criteria you searched for. Most of the time you will be told that \"the connection to the opponent has been lost\". You might think that this is your potential opponent declining your request, but in the majority of times it is in fact the game struggling to connect. However, this will most likely be fixed and when it happens I will remove this from the review.",

The stages and music incorporate beautifully on-screen as they add tension and emotion into every match. Paired with the dynamic relation of fast action with a slow tempo, creates an environment in which fights are agitated, and every round counts. Keep reading to know what makes  7 great! features an extensive roster with a staggering number of 49 characters! Each of them shares some common ground in their basic gameplay, but have unique styles in how they handle the combat base on their strengths. , for example, has a high reach that allows him to defend against attacks or keep opponents at bay. In contrast, other fighters as  can fill bars to increase the power of their moves and behave more erratic. Playing each character, you would realize that despite having some singularities, the way you move and face opponents will change drastically.In contrast to the gameplay of its roster, I didn't enjoy the story too much in my time with the game, it is not that is bad itself but that it was pretty short and lacked more content. Overall it did a stable job in terms of quality. Still, it ends up being more of a \"discounted\" experience rather than a fully immersive one. I did enjoy that characters speak in their associated language even though it broke the flow at times since it looks as if everyone knows how to talk in about every language. Like when  speaks in Japanese and  speaks in English. The fights in the game are dynamic; they can be fast-paced or have a slow tempo depending on each player's action. It is an intricate dance as  focuses more on figuring out your opponent in a set of 3 rounds. It is about figuring how your adversary thinks. The more you can predict and adapt on the fly to their play-style, the better you will do. Some combos can be extended with walls or  to deal more damage. Also, each character has particular moves, such as projectiles, gap closers, dodging attacks, or movements that cannot be interrupted.Graphically speaking,  leaves something to be desired. Characters' hair can, at times, look bad. At the same time, it's visuals fail to impress, feeling more like a title from an older generation. The game carries out as a service with content that is being added to it so. Still, there are titles of the same category looking better. I wish they would have worked this aspect to take full advantage of its stages and character customization.Something I don't see a lot of people talk about is the fantastic soundtrack that  has. The music is outstanding as it pumps you up, reflecting the energy of combat. Its weight is noticeable as its rhythm changes during the last rounds to exhibit the emotion of the fight. It goes even beyond that as it creates an environment for the players. An example is fan-favorite , which is harmonic and is a track that is perfect for listening to while in training mode, developing one craft. Meanwhile,  gives the aura of a \"final battle\" or \"betting everything\" with the high pumping, melodic singing, and explosiveness of the song!Customization is another great aspect of ! The only thing I noticed that I didn't like is that all of the items are locked to  The mode itself is not awful, but it can become pretty stale quickly as you only fight versus the CPU. It develops into a boring grinding to get clothes and accessories to make your characters stand out more. It can serve as some practice in the meantime, and the modifiers are fun at first, but my interest in it died out pretty quickly as it was tedious at best.The strong point of this title, in addition to all the gameplay elements, is customization. While as stated before the grinding can be tedious, the options to the player disposal are limitless! From butterfly wings to have a  on top of your head that keeps crumbling every time you are hit. They can give birth to some incredible characters, glamour, and personalize them to your taste. Whenever you want to make your golden warriors, cute fighter, or the most strange ideas, there is a lot to try, and it is a lot of fun to do so!The weak point of  is probably the barrier for newbies to get into the game. It is easy to get into but hard to master, and the depth of its combat, combos, and characters can be too much at times for a newer player to wrap their head around. It doesn't help that it has an arcade formula to it, meaning that there are not many flashy moves or assist in helping newbies. There is nothing wrong with any of those elements. It's just that it might be daring for newcomers, and tutorials being lacking doesn't help the case. A fascinating aspect is that rather than making a new entry of the game,  opted to carry it out as a service and kept adding content. There are guest characters such as  from  and  from the  while favorites such as  come back! In addition to this, there are extra modes and customization options released as DLC, along with stages. The thing is, acquiring all of that content can be quite pricey. For a total of $80, it is quite a high price for all of it. Characters have different prices assigned to them, with guest characters being a bit more expensive. At the same time, modes such a  can cost the same as up to 3 additional characters while being lacking. They also made the terrible decision of locking frame data behind a pay-wall as you have to pay to unlock it when it should have been free. The game ran pretty well on a GTX 1060 with an Intel Core i7-8750H resulting in a locked 60FPS with setting set to max and the render scale on 200%, there are three different season passes in total. is a fantastic game to get into if you are looking for a fighting game with a lot of depth, and you don't mind having to learn and practice your craft to perfect it. It is more demanding than its peers in the dedication that needs to be put into it. Still, with a lot of content on the base game plus the DLC and the online being solid, it is a good buy for anyone interested in it and for fans of fighting games. If you are looking to get into the genre for the first time, either consider other options or get in it with a lot of patience. A great game overall with a lot going for it despite some failed decisions, I had a good time with",

But if you're looking for a good 3D fighter to play, especially if you're able to have local matches with friends, it'll get the job done.+ Seems well optimized, I think it can run on a lot of the hardware that's out there in the wild.  No problems whatsoever on my i5 3570k with a gtx 970.+ When I could find matches for online, the connection seemed alright.+ Akuma is a really interesting addition to the cast and is a great representation of the Capcom character.+ Rage Drives -- a technically complex mechanic that allows for some great (and impressive looking) combos if you can manage to find the execution necessary to pull them off.- Rage arts.  Tekken did not need the equivalent of super/ultra moves from other fighting games.  It tries to add a comeback mechanic that wasn't really needed for some reason and doesn't really add anything or help casuals pick the game up.- Not in love with the character redesigns either (for the most part); at least Bandai Namco gave alternates that could be used that were more like the Nostalgia costumes Cacpom charges for.- Surprisingly, it was possible to somehow pre-order and not receive Eliza.  Not only this, but she is apparently not available in the Season Pass or as part of the Deluxe Edition overall. However, she appears in game during the Treasure Mode as AI.- Online already seems dead.  If you don't have friends to play against, you may have trouble finding a match.Arguably the best 3D fighter on Steam, but it leaves me longing for a port of TTT2 or Tekken 5/6.",

He has a playlist of videos where he goes over the fundamentals of the game in probably the most entertaining manner possible. Generally just keep up with this guy if you want to follow the game.Second, get into the competitive scene. Fighting games are a lot more fun when you're playing them with other people, and doing things like going to local tournaments can help you learn the game even better. Watching professionals play the game is also pretty fun and educational as well.Third, pick a character and go with it. Tekken, at most skill levels, is probably one of the most balanced fighting games out there, and don't let stoners convince you otherwise. DLC characters are fun to play with but cost a bit of money, so maybe explore a bit of that character before buying anything.Finally, stay calm and be respectful. There are plenty of people in this community who will be rude inside the game and out. Keep your cool or else the game doesn't become fun. Also, make it a point to NOT message Harada or Michael Murray on Twitter.If you stick with it, Tekken can be a very fun and rewarding experience. There's so many intricacies to it that allow you learn something about it every time you play it. There are more people following this game now than ever, so now is the time to jump into it.",

                "text": "Before I start the review, please note that I played the game using the following equipment:With that out of the way, here is the review.Tekken 7...Tekken 7 runs well on my machine. The game runs 60 frames per second at maxed settings, in borderless fullscreen, at my monitor's strange screen resolution of 1680x1050. I've had absolutely no issues with running the game.My experience with Tekken 7's netcode has been positive. It's rare that I play a match with noticeable input lag. I live on the Canadian west coast, and I've played good matches with people in east Canada. Canada's a big country, so that fact and what I just wrote should tell you volumes about the quality of Tekken 7's netcode.You should experience good matches most of the time if you live in North America, Europe, or east Asia, places with a large population of Tekken players.Tekken gives its players so many options to use for offense, defense, and the neutral game that players can really just play however they want. You're never really locked into playing a certain way because you play a certain character. Characters in this game have dozens of moves (some characters have more than 100 moves!), so they're quite versatile. I know it sounds cheesy, but you can express yourself through how you play in Tekken.Thanks to Tekken's wealth of moves, techniques, and system mechanics, Tekken 7 ends up being a very open-ended game.Because Tekken's gameplay is so open-ended, Tekken ends up being about what great fighting games are about. It's about constantly evolving strategy and counterstrategy, precise spacing and positioning, technical skill, and 'mind-\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665' (conditioning, baits, and reads), and not so much about 50/50s (situations where the defender must guess, from a restricted set of options, what to do to defend against an attacker's offense).Tekken's so open that sometimes you might even think it's too open. There are just so many moves you need to learn to deal with.You might call 'cheap' when you get hit by some moves you don't know how to defend against or punish, but once you understand how to defend against and punish those moves, Tekken really is a fair game. I've gone from hating fighting Eddy to loving fighting Eddy now that I know how to deal with some of his moves.Tekken 7's story mode is very short, and really isn't all that thrilling. For every minute of sick cutscene action story mode presents, story mode presents two minutes of boring narraration-driven exposition. It's a shame that the story is told largely in such a boring way\u2014Heihachi's story is kind of cool.Tekken's arcade mode is standard fare and treasure battle is basically an endless arcade mode that pays out cosmetic rewards. There's little reason to play arcade mode, but Treasure battle is worth playing to unlock cosmetic items.And on the note of cosmetics, Tekken 7's customization mode is the best single player mode Tekken 7 has to offer. I say this with confidence as a degenerate Lili player. The customization options are lacking compared to Tekken Tag Tournament 2, but for the most part you can get your character looking the way you want him/her to look.Customizations have really enhanced my playing experience. Thanks to them, Lili mirror matches are also fashion shows in addition to just being fights.Tekken 7's netcode is good, but it's player match lobbies are no good. The lobbies are really buggy, often causing players to disconnect from the lobby, causing players to skip their turn for a match, or causing players to be unable to spectate matches. Tekken 7's lobbies come with plenty of waiting and frustration and really need to be fixed.The quick match experience is functional, and is thus my preferred way of finding matches online, but even that mode comes with a lot of waiting. Matchmaking can take a while thanks to the loading time between rematches being unnecessarily long. For whatever reason the game needs to reload the stage and characters it already loaded in the previous match.If you're new to Tekken, or fighting games in general, know that Tekken 7 teaches you absolutely nothing about how to play Tekken 7. It doesn't feature a tutorial so you're going to have to find educational material from outside of the game to learn from if you want to learn how to play the game.You can mash around and have some fun, but you're never going to experience the best experience Tekken has to offer if you don't evolve beyond mashing. You'd be forced to play smartly anyway if you want to experience even a little bit of online success: the low online ranks which used to be full of scrubby players are now full of killers. If you're new, you're going to get bodied.Heck, even if you've played for a while, you're gonna lose a bunch. Even with my ~200 hours of experience with this game I really don't know all that much about Tekken. I maybe know less than 20% of the moves in the game, so I often get caught off guard by some moves I don't know much about. I'm constantly having to learn to deal with new moves under stressful situations.Double heck, I keep getting hit by moves I know how to deal with anyway because my reactions are non-existent sometimes!Tekken's brutal.Don't even think about buying this game for its single-player experience. Tekken 7's single-player experience is sorely lacking. The story mode bores more often than it entertains, arcade mode and treasure battle mode bore quickly because computer opponents don't make for interesting or difficult opposition, and customization mode is really only relevant if you play online. I mean, what's the point of customizing your character if no one sees your customization?If you're interested in fighting people online, then Tekken 7 might a good investment. This game is packed with moves and techniques to learn and master, and is home to fierce competition. If you have the drive to \"git gud\" and have the patience to put up with losing a lot, then I think you might enjoy this game.If you already don't like fighting games, you won't like this game. There's nothing here that would make you change your mind about fighting games.If you already like fighting games, you'll probably like this game.I love this game (even though I'm not good at it!), hence this stupidly long Steam review.",

However I can speak about my experience, which has been great, for a new player honestly I have only one very important thing to say. Play. Ranked. Even if you don't care about tryharding, no, DEFINITELY if you don't care about tryharding. Play ranked as if it was not ranked, it will benefit you so, so much. Primarily because you won't get randomly matched with an 800+ win player who will just body you into the dirt and leave you feeling you couldn't do or even learn anything. The second reason is, skill based matchmaking can only be good for a newcomer. I am floating around the ass end of LIGHT  blue (which is the scrubbiest of ranks) and guess what, I'm having a blast! And I'm not even playing brain dead just to mash buttons, I do my best, I try (and drop) combos, I try (and fail) punishes, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but almost always I enjoy the match. So to reiterate, as a beginner: Play. Ranked.EDIT: my most sincere apologies about the blue thing, I just assumed its blue cause I didnt know blue was a color in later ranks",

The reason for the negative review has more to do with the terrible way the DLC is being handled.I've been playing Tekken for over 20 years, so when Tekken 7 dropped on PC it was an insta-buy for me. I didn't mind paying full price and I even bought the Season pass as well because I foolishly assumed that I would have gotten ALL the classic DLC characters when they were released. Turns out I was wrong...In fact, it turns out that the Season Pass included absolutely none of the classic characters I wanted, a bunch of ridiculous cosmetics, and a crappy bowling game. Originally, I didn't blink at throwing $80 at one of my favorite franchises, but as time went on and I waited (and waited) for my classic characters to be added to the roster... they never were. And then there was Season 2! Which, (content wise) would have been awesome...IF IT WAS INCLUDED WITH THE ORIGINAL SEASON PASS. Anyways, I admit I was naive. I should have never assumed that a game company might actually cater to their customer and make them feel like they got their moneys worth, rather than treat them like nameless, souless, money dispensers to fleece at will. How stupid of me to believe in fairy tales right? Really, it's cool Namco/Bandai (or who/whatever greedy, self-dilluded turd thinks that this is an acceptable business model) After all, Business is business, reviews are reviews, and at the end of the day my meager wallet is still in my pocket. I will just be sure to never purchase from this company again unless it's at 75% off or more, seeing as I got about 25% of the content I wanted for full price.",

                "text": "To clarify, I've played a tiny bit of Tekken 4 on PS2 and Tekken 6 on PS Vita, but that's the extent of my previous experience. I barely played either of these and I just button mashed, so I'll call myself a Tekken noob and say that this game is my first 'real experience' in playing a Tekken game. I pre-ordered this game without knowing how well it will be optimized on PC, if the online servers will work, if it supports controllers, etc. To my amazement, Tekken 7 on day 1 tackled all of these.Constant 60 fps is vital in this game as framerate drops will affect button inputs. This game is extremely smooth to run on ultra settings whilst maintaining constant 60 fps (at 1920x1080 on a GTX 1060) though borderless windowed settings forces me to run at 3840x2160 for some reason, but this does not seem to affect system performance at all. Only drops you will see are the loading cutscenes where it will run at 30 fps, but who cares about that?Amazing. Simply amazing. Day 1 release gives you a whopping 37 characters to choose from (38 if you got Eliza as a pre-order bonus) with 10 of them being new characters. The characters all speak in their native language, so I found myself very confused when they all seemed to understand what each other was saying during the story (a great example of this is the dialogue between Nina, Heihachi and Claudio). However, this is by no means a downside as we don't have to hear horrible dubbed voices of foreign characters, but instead it feels more natural and fitting.Not only are there a wide selection of characters, but there are also 20 stages to choose from. The stages have different layouts so it doesn't feel repetitive. You'll have stages with and without walls, some which are octagonal shaped, others which are square shaped and even stages with multiple platforms that can be broken through by using certain moves. Each stage has it's own music piece composed to it and gives it a sense of uniqueness. Oh, and they all look great too.I found the story to be very interesting and gripping at times, but I also found it to be quite short. For the most part it's spending 5 minutes watching a cutscene, fighting someone and then rinse and repeat. Though I guess for a fighting game not much else can be done. I completed the story in a couple of hours in a single sitting along with the extra character episodes unlocked after completing the main story. I found myself hysterically laughing at certain character episodes (Paul vs. Panda and Lucky Chloe vs. Eddy are the two that come to mind) and it was just really fun overall. But as I previously mentioned it is VERY short.I gotta say, the gameplay is near-flawless. For a fighting game noob, I was able to quickly pick up characters I have never even played before and within an hour or so I would come to grips with their playstyle and how to use them. Blocking is done simply by holding back for mid and air attacks and down-back for low attacks, there is no button input required and it is as simple as that. Most characters have very easy 3 or 4 hit combos which is helpful when starting out with a new character. One thing I am not too impressed with however is the inclusion of 'rage arts'. I understand that it is included to help give players an edge when they have low hp, but it honestly just feels cheap. Not to mention that Akuma's rage art can not be blocked, but only evaded by sidestepping or jumping at the right time.Because who would ever dare to play a fighting game with keyboard and mouse? I play this game using my PS4 controller and seems to work flawlessly. The button layout however still shows the Xbox controller button layout, but this isn't an issue at all. I really appreciate the inclusion of custom controller input bindings so I can easily bind multiple buttons to a single button (LP+RP to L1 for example).The soundtrack is quite possibly the best soundtrack of any game I have ever played. There isn't a single track that I have disliked and I have found myself sitting in the character select screen and certain maps in practice whilst I do other tasks just so I can listen to the soundtrack in the background. Honestly even if you don't like fighting games, at least listen to the soundtrack and you will not be disappointed.It's honestly hard to fault this game, it is quite possibly the best fighting game of all time. I love every aspect of this game from the characters to the soundtrack. The game runs very smoothly so I have no issues with input lag and I just find myself falling in love with this game more and more each day. The only issue I have found is that you will sometimes lose connection to a host before you have even joined them, but otherwise online also works flawlessly with no noticable lag.",

Typically I will only play them casually and throw them in the backlog after beating the story mode. I never felt that I was capable of reaching a competetive level in a fighting game. I don't have amazing reflexes or memorization, and the thought of playing a single character and mastering them felt boring to me when there are so many other characters to play.There's something about the way Tekken 7 feels when you're playing that just makes sense. The combo system is fluid and intuitive. The clarity of what's going on and what I'm supposed to do is unmatched compared to other fighters like Street Fighter. You feel like you have the ability to do what is expected of you. Then you fight someone better than you and get your ass beat.On the surface, Tekken 7 is a barebones fighting game with a minimalistic story mode and no tutorial. Luckily, various resources exist online to teach you how to play. If this game did not have the clarity, balance, and intuitive fundementals that make it fun to both play and watch, it would have flopped. If you like competetive fighting games, it's a must buy. If you don't, watch some Tekken 7 tournaments first, it might convert you.",

This can be very intimidating for new players early on especially since there is no support from the developers.Bloated cast - As much as everyone is unique and interesting to play, there are far too many characters in this iteration of Tekken, making it very difficult for newcomers to learn matchups.As you can see the cons outweigh the pros somewhat, however despite this I am still able to recommend this game despite its shortcomings due the community surrounding the game and just how enjoyable to play the game can be.My advice for new players is to take your time, as mentioned above you could argue that this is the hardest fighting game available to play and playing online with the weird netcode can be frustrating so I suggest hitting training most ASAP and picking someone you like the look of regardless of \"tier\" and just get a feel for the game.",

The developers are lazy, and Bandai Namco is as corporate greed as it gets. They celebrated 8 million sales with a definitive edition that is 60 dollars and doesn't even include all of the content. \"How should we reward our fans?\" Sell them the game again! (incomplete of course, can't include that juicy licensed content!)The online netcode is horrible. They claimed they implemented working rollback (Harada, the creator of Tekken has demonstrated he does not actually know what rollback is on several occasions). Anyone not in your region is a SLOG to play. In a game with plenty of just-frame inputs, seeable moves, and reactions being a major part of the game? Really? \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 netcode? Sad honestly. Especially considering how much money this game has made, and 100x smaller and less funded projects have fantastic rollback via GGPO. Where is all the money going that you're milking out of fans? Not to mention you have to PAY for in-game frame data. You have to PAY to lab against the DLC characters. The trend here is not unintentional. The developers that balance the game have absolutely no idea what they're doing. I'm not sure if it's intentional to sell DLC characters or if it's just laziness/ignorance. Fakhumrahm, Leroy, Zafina, Geese, Akuma, Julia, Kuni, Lidia all have some absurd trait that completely sets them apart from the rest of the cast. Meanwhile bottom tiers like Gigas get completely absentminded additions to their kits, while they provide DLC characters with the most perfectly rounded kits I've ever seen in a fighting game.The stages are lazily made. There are several copy+paste/palette swap stages. There are three infinite stages. Each character is FULL of gimmicks and moves that require specific situational awareness or you will get blown up. The ranked system is complete garbage and un-intuitive. Why would I gain less ranked points for beating someone who is much higher ranked than I am? Everything about this game is completely shameless. I will never recommend this game to any fighting game newcomer, or anyone at all for that matter. Try out GGST or something. Maybe Tekken 8 will be better. I highly doubt it considering what we've seen from this sad excuse of a company. It's fun tho.",

                "text": "If you still have a positive memories from childhood about the Tekken game series, then I would highly advise you not to play this game online, versus other players, especially avoid ranked games. This game has a lot of scummy and toxic players which tend to abuse the possibility of the PC version for their own benefit like alt+f4, macros users, tons of smurfs and more.If I could I would definitely refund this game for a price which I paid when I pre-ordered it. (huge mistake) The main problem that Tekken has are players which abuses the alt+f4...especially they abuse this when they are loosing the match or being launched, sometimes it even bugs out the game and crashes it, a lot of my time was wasted in the fake matches and on re-launching the game.Scroll below to see  39 screenshots with scummy players which performed the alt+f4 on me,  there were a lot more of players like those but as I said above the abusing move sometimes would crash my game and I simply couldn't capture those dirtbags... ( + 2 bonus screenshots of win strike abusers )Another problem is that community has A LOT of toxic players which insulted me, my family members  even my pets (lol), wished me a lot of disgusting and negative things.( which sometimes would destroy my entire mood for the entire day and make me to uninstall the game) I would receive such kind of behavior for simply winning an  opponent, as I see now people take defeat too personally in a 1v1 game,  other causes which led to the toxic behavior from other players - me quitting after playing one match, performing to poorly against opponent or even super weird one - I was insulted for losing the match to fast!!! simply whaat? ( all these information is taken from my own experience )I can say that in-game toxicity has it own culture, there are players which will ki-charge you ( means that they disrespect you )  squat or teabag you, a lot of smurf accounts that will stand afk and wait until you do a mistake to launch you, good luck to do any damage to them or even win them. I've removed more than 40+ negative commentaries from my profile page, blocked around the same amount of players on steam and I have lost count how many friend invites I have declined after winning the opponent and leaving afterwards.  People take defeat too seriously and personally, which lead to a super toxic behavior that kills the entire mood of continuing to play this game and seriously I thought that other online games were toxic, but how wrong I was this game is a Toxic Gold Mine. 300 Hours of online experience:Bonus Win strike abusers: ( these kind of players would abuse alt+f4 when they're losing to maintain the their win strike )",

This is a great fighting game with beautiful and colorful Unreal Engine 4 graphics. You can use your game controller with no problem and with several game modes available, playing feels rewarding. I personally love treasure battle which is like an arcade mode, but you can unlock dozens of items and earn in-game money to buy even more (with no microtransactions whatsoever), customization is AMAZING, I love how deep it is (for a fighting game). Combat is fluid and fun and also feels balanced. There is a large character roster to pick from (36 and 37 if you include pre-order). Characters have very different fighting styles and have a lot of personality. Music and sounds are cool.So, in a nutshell, Tekken is awesome. Well done Namco!Es realmente agradable ver como m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s franquicias de juegos de pelea finalmente est\u00e1n llegando a la PC y Tekken no es una decepci\u00f3n. Este es un gran juego de pelea con hermosos y coloridos gr\u00e1ficos de Unreal Engine 4. Puedes utilizar tu control para jugar sin problema y con varios modos de juego, jugarlo es estimulante. Personalmente me encante la batalla por tesoros, la cual es como un modo arcade, pero puedes desbloquear docenas de \u00edtems y ganar dinero del juego para comprar a\u00fan m\u00e1s (sin microtransacciones en absoluto), la personalizaci\u00f3n es ASOMBROSA, me encanta que tan profunda es (para un juego de peleas). El combate es fluido y divertido y tambi\u00e9n se siente balanceado. Hay una gran lista de personajes a elegir (36 y 37 si incluyes la precompra). Los personajes tienen diferentes estilos de pelea y bastante personalidad. El sonido y la m\u00fasica son geniales. Entonces, en pocas palabras, Tekken es incre\u00edble. \u00a1Bien hecho Namco!",

                "text": "I highly recommend this game.Every once in a while I feel I find a game that is the epitome of its genre. Tekken is a fighting game in its purest form. If you are looking for a game to obsess over, Tekken can keep your attention for the rest of time. If you are feeling extremely competitive then this game will scratch that itch. Every character has a VASTLY different playstyle and each comes with their own sort of reputation. Nina and Kazuya players know how to get real serious. Yoshimitsu and Panda players know how to party. Law and Dragunov can explode at any moment and they'll keep you on the edge of your seat. King and Devil Jin players are ready to make a spectacle. There are so many martial arts styles covered like Capoeira, Sambo, Majiquan, Boxing, and recently Muay Thai and Wing Chun. A couple of warnings. The balance can sometimes be a little off. DLC characters sometimes come out a lot stronger than other characters and there's not much a player can do about that except try their best. Back in Season 2 they accidentally made Akuma (Yes, the guy from Street Fighter) a little too powerful and a couple people started pulling off 100% combos in tournament. More recently Season 3 buffed almost every character and there was a big power creep. Leroy Smith was released and was so good that they had to make a new spot on the teir list. The online can be pretty bad at times and there's not a lot that can be done about it at this point. Unreal Engine is fantastic but it has limitations like anything else. I haven't played much single player and from what I've seen it's not why you buy this game. You unlock every cosmetic (Except DLC) after 2,000 fights so don't grind for unlocks. That said this game is wonderful. When you do get locked into a good game with someone, Tekken gets very immersive! It's like playing lightning chess. Both players are making plans on the fly. You are both thinking about high/mid/low/grab/rage/(!) mixups, frame advantage, spacing/side stepping, the stage, character movesets, mental conditioning, recognizing habits, and just trying to outwit the other player. It's not over until the announcer says KO, you can come back and win even if you only have 1 HP left. The depth of this game is astounding. No other fighting game can keep your attention like Tekken. There's a huge amount of player freedom: characters often have multiple taunts, secret moves, silly moves like backflips and  that can do damage, so many fun stances,  This game has a steep learning curve that never really levels off. There is always more to learn and you can always get better. There will always be a new challenge to overcome. I play mostly online but there is a thriving global tournament scene. It's a mix of old arcade players and younger fighting game rookies. There are still new players all the time so don't worry about not finding someone that matches your abilities. You can always find someone in a Discord server ready to play. If you ever see me online just know that I'm always trying to clown around. I'll throw you over my shoulder into the wall to finish the round because I'm winning and I'm having fun.Edit: Season 4 is a huge improvement. They rebalanced some aspects of the game and it got rid of the unreasonable combo damage some characters were getting. Also the netplay got an update, and while some matches are still a stuttery mess, most feel like flawless rollback netcode with just a very slight manageable delay. The future of the series is uncertain, but I can say this is probably the best that Tekken has ever been. There are new players all the time so don't be afraid to jump in and start from scratch. This is by far the best fighting game I have ever played.",

                "text": "I previously had minimal experience playing fighting games but in July 2019 I decided to buy Tekken 7 for PlayStation 4 and can honestly say that it changed my life. Since then, I've also bought both the Xbox One and PC versions just so I could play against as many different people as possible. I've put in over 1000 hours of gameplay across all three platforms and have gone from being a total noob to reaching a peak rank of Tekken King (rank 33) with Kuma -- there are 37 ranks in Tekken 7, each one exponentially more difficult to achieve than the last as you must consistently defeat opponents within two ranks of yourself to rank up, but consistent losses to opponents within two ranks of yourself will cause you to rank down. The competition online becomes pretty hardcore at around rank 24 (Mighty Ruler), so any rank above that generally signifies a player highly skilled with that character. Never before have I spent so much time outside of a game looking to improve my skills by reading strategies online and watching videos of experts in an effort to become ranked as high as I possibly can.Tekken gives back as much as you put in and even 1000+ hours later there are still numerous techniques I'm yet to master and moves I'm yet to commit to memory -- and that's with just a handful of the 51 characters on the roster. There is never a moment wasted whilst playing as you're always learning something new and honing your skills. The way the momentum can instantly shift from a well-timed counter hit makes each match so dynamic and exhilarating, and it means epic comebacks are never out of the question.That's not to suggest that the game is flawless -- far from it. For example: the load times are lengthy (made more frustrating by the inability to instantly rematch), the user interface is rudimentary and dull, there are very few modes, there are no tutorials, and rage quitting is common as there is minimal punishment for doing so. The Rage Art, Rage Drive, and Power Crush mechanics are very controversial amongst the playerbase but I personally think they're great as they keep every round tense from start to finish.It's also perhaps worth mentioning that after enjoying this game so much I played some Tekken 6 and Tekken Tag Tournament 2 and can confidently say that, whilst still fun, they are nowhere near as enjoyable as Tekken 7 in my opinion. So there is definitely something special here; this isn't just an iterative sequel that I've only fallen in love with due to a lack of experience with the previous games in the series. I also played Tekken 3 and Tekken 5 back in the day but, again, never enough to actually get good at them.Tekken 7 is an absolute masterpiece and has become, without question, my favourite competitive multiplayer game of all time. I'm 30 years old and have been a hardcore gamer all my life but no other game has even come close to the enjoyment, adrenaline, satisfaction, and sense of achievement that winning a single close-fought match in Tekken 7 can give me. If you're considering this game for its single-player then there are certainly better options out there such as Mortal Kombat 11 or Injustice 2, but when it comes to competitive fighting games then Tekken 7 simply has no equal.Welcome to the King of Iron Fist Tournament 7. Get ready for the next battle.",

Bamco have said that there will be other characters added by DLC. Old/missing Tekken characters are to be added at no cost apparently, but new charaters will probably be charged for if there are any. I'm using my PS3 Dual shock here and it works a treat. Just like playing on playstation, but its on my PC! With 4K 60FPS graphics ULTRA !!! Looks great and plays great! Story mode is ok, the end battle is a little frustrating I will admit. You also have treasure battle, arcade mode, practice and online ranked/unranked and tournaments. Online is working quite well. The tournaments maybe need tweaking, but on the whole I have not encountered any major issues playing online. Overall I would thoroughly reccomend this game to anyone who likes fighting games in general.The BEST fighting game has come to PC and it is now THE BEST FIGHTING GAME ON PC bar none!",

                "text": "or let me say this; When we think of old video games, our subconscious mind goes to childhood or adolescence games. Games that we dig into our memories to see that makeup half of our memories. Definitely one of those games is Tekken, which, with its release on Sony's first console, was able to attract a lot of fans and become one of the serious competitors for Mortal Kombat. Years pass, and these two veteran rivals have risen alongside each other. Two fighting games with different shapes and icons for fans, one targeting the East style and the other the West style. Of course, the presence of other fighting games such as the Injustice series has led Mortal Kombat's production team to target a wider audience.when that  has been released, it was time for Tekken 7 to show itself. The main question here is, was Tekken 7 as good as it looks?\"Children begin their work with the love and affection of their parents, soon after judging them and finally forgiving infrequently.\"<< BEFORE READING: next paragraph contains spoiler >>The STORY of the game is narrated according to this quote. Where Kazuya Mishima's hatred of his father is well portrayed. On the other hand, the story of Tekken 7 will show the audience what caused the death of Kazumi by Heihachi and why Kazuya hates his father. The story of the game cannot be considered the end of the Mishima family's war and conflict, but it closes the case of the events between father and son. The story is told in the language of a narrator. A journalist who has started researching Mishima Zaybatso and G company and intends to find the reason for the destruction of his hometown. Tekken 7 includes a main story and a side story, in the main story, the events are narrated in three different branches, and finally, they are in the same direction and are well summarized. On the one hand, Kazuya, who intends to destroy Heihachi and avenge his childhood and his mother's. Akuma, on the other hand, enters the field. Someone who has promised Kazumi in the past to destroy Heihachi. Now that these characters are taking revenge, the Tex Force team is trying to find Jin Kazama and bring him back to Mishima zaibatsu<<END OF SPOILER>> in a fighting game, gameplay plays the most important role. That the game can satisfy the audience well in the combat system or other areas is the most important factor that any fighting game should consider. Therefore, Tekken 7 has shown itself well in this section. Most fighting games try to modernize, however, Tekken 7 is well-balanced between a modern fighting game and a classic fighting game. The presence of old combos, the animation style of the fights, and the movement of the players are all reminiscent of the previous versions, which are available here with new elements. The most important thing to consider is how to use Rage Art. In fact, Rage Arts are the special combinations of players that you can use. As your health bar approaches critical conditions, a red halo appears around you, signaling the activation of Rage Art. Now you can use serious buttons to inflict serious damage on your opponent. Other gameplay features that give the game a fresh look is Power Crush, which allows you to hit your opponent when you're being hit and stop their combo. The slow-motion feature has also been added to this version since the sixth version to once again illustrate the sensitivity of all-time kicks. Now suppose that all these combat capabilities and features will find their true meaning when they being used in great combos and continue hitting when your opponent is between heaven and earth and don't let your opponent get a chance to hit. You can also use the walls of the game environment to combine your shots and do more damage to the opponent. The availability of these features has not only not made the gameplay crowded, but has made the fights more precise; Find out exactly when you need to use your Rage Art or Rage Move, when to hit and when to hit your opponent harder, or when to use a combination of environments combo.Aside from storytelling, gameplay in both offline and online includes a variety of combat modes, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. In the offline section, the arcade mode of the game includes fights with AI. When I entered this section, I expected to see several fights for each character, but for each character, there are only five fights, among which Heihachi and Kazumi that are present in all the fights. In other words, you only have three fights in which the AI \u200b\u200bcharacters are random and new. After a while, the arcade mode will make you very tired and you may not go to this section anymore. But no matter how weak the arcade mode, Treasure Battle mode compensates for it. In this part, you will fight your favorite characters with other characters in the game, and then you will have a series of special competitions with Heihachi, Jin, Akuma, and Kazuya.There are two things you can never get tired of in treasure mode. The first is the greater number of fights than the arcade section, and the second and most important is the availability of chests at the end and beginning of each match. Now, another difference between the arcade mode and the Treasure Battle mode is the game's AI (artificial intelligence). In the story section, you can determine the artificial intelligence and the difficulty yourself, but in this section, there are no such options. Therefore, we see the rank-based difficulty.The online part is another pillar of the Tekken 7 gameplay; Where players from all over the world come together to test their skills. The online part of the game consists of three different modes. The first mode of Player Match that you will compete with other players or you can create a lobby yourself so that the players can connect to you and play. In both Ranked and Player Match modes, you can hardly find an opponent, and if it is found, your ping is so different from your opponent that you are all over the game during the game, or you can't connect to the opponent's server and player at all. Now the only part of the tournament that you can easily play with others (of course, if we factor in ping problems). Of course, sometimes during the tournament, the host may lose and leave the game. Then you will leave the tournament and all your efforts will be wasted, and unfortunately, there is no specific punishment for the violators.One thing that has always stood out in the Tekken series is the game's graphics and game design. Thanks to the Unreal Engine 4 graphics engine, the development team has tried to strike a balance between classic and modern in the game's graphics. The struggles and designs of the environment and the characters all promise a classic Tekken game. Apart from that, Tekken 7's combat environments have a good variety, and some of them include two combat places that, if your fight lasts, you will see that the place you're fighting in, will be ruined by your hits and opponent falls and enter another part of the place. With all these interpretations, Tekken 7 came back after years of waiting for the fans of this series to make good moments for them again. An original oriental fighting game that has been around for about 20 years and has tried to add new elements to its audience experiences. Apparently, the game never intends to make big changes, and that could be good news for fans.",

                "text": "Muse Dash is a rhythm action game developed by Chinese studio called PeroPeroGames. Steam version is completed mobile port which share same price of base game.Muse Dash is like a warm place where you sit back and enjoy both music and visual. Subjectively, I was drawn colorful art design and stylish flashy characters (which remind me of anime like Panty and Stocking). The game has hybrid concept between side-scrolling beat \u2018em up on the rail and rhythm beat which are executed very well.The control is tight and responsive compared to mobile touch pad. You simply control character using two keyboard buttons (which can be modified or set alternate keys via option). One key is to hit enemy notes at ground level and another one is to hit enemy notes on the air. It sounds simple, but also challenges sense of rhythm of player where you face variant types of note from common long note to invisible note. Dodging sawblade notes and utilizing your timing to maintain combo and character HP to the end of song.Similar to other rhythm games, the game has judge system (indicates input accuracy based on timing), but is more much simplified and forgiving as \u201cPerfect\u201d, \u201cGreat\u201d, \u201cPass\u201d, and \u201cMiss\u201d that will break your current combo and affect overall accuracy. The game will also enter \u201cFever mode\u201d once player maintains amount of combo, allow player to boost score in short period and can be set as manual spacebar key.Your starter character is Rin. By completing any songs regardless of difficulty, you will gain user EXP for leveling up. Each level will unlock random troves used to unlock new playable characters (Rin, Buro, Marija), new elfins (supporting companions), and many beautiful illustration (allow you to customize loading screen). The process is random and varied for each user, but player will easily unlock everything at certain point.Speaking of characters, each main character has different 4-5 costumes, theme, and likeable personalities. Both costumes and elfins provide player benefit one way or another based on playstyle and specific gimmick. Some can match up with elfin to boost extra scores or maintain HP. Some can use to boost overall accuracy or lengthen judge area to the point you feel comfortable and familiar with beats. The system is friendly for casual players while keeping master challenge for veterans.The game offers 3 difficulties (Easy, Hard, and Master except for few default songs). Master difficulty only unlock when player completes \u201cS Rank\u201d on hard (90% accuracy). Higher difficulty contains more notes that synchronize most beats of the track or completely replace different sequences from Easy and Hard. It may sounds hard on paper, but as I consider myself as average player for this genre. It\u2019s common for every rhythm games that you invest time for practicing to the point that it becomes muscle memory. Combine with strong visual feedback from beating wave of enemy notes and bosses at end of level. It\u2019s such an addictive and satisfying gameplay loop that I genuinely enjoy everyday regardless of scoreboard.Muse Dash offers great variety of songs (both vocal and instrumental). For example: dubstep, eurobeat, EDM, Jazz, vlolin, vocaloid, pop, mystical, BMS, and other mixup. You may expect some Chinese vocal songs and some Japanese songs. But they are overall catchy and aesthetic in their own way. It also encourages me to dig into meaningful lyrics and discover more talented cover / composers. There are some familiar songs that share among other rhythm games (Arcaea, DJMax, Maimai, and more) such as \u201cconflict\u201d, \u201cDestr0yer\u201d, \u201cPUPA\u201d, \u201cMilK\u201d, and much more.The base game has total 52 initial songs (43 default songs, 3 Nanocore, 6 Budget is Burning) with $3 price tag served as standard version, provide full access of all characters and elfins to experiment. It\u2019s worth checking without DLC to get a grasp how the game plays out.While mobile version has various bundles, Steam version has single DLC called \u201cJust as planned\u201d with current 132 extra songs (free 6 songs will be added every month). This DLC serves as one-time payment for long-term support if player really interests into the gameplay and music types. I personally think $30 price tag is reasonably worth considering amount of licensed songs the developers have to pay and generate notes for each song. If you\u2019re still uncomfortable for a price and expectation which understandable in some regions, you can follow the game page and wait for DLC sale.Muse Dash runs on Unity game engine with friendly spec requirement and well optimization. I had no performance issue or FPS drop during 37 hours of playtime. Stylish and flashy UI, but easy to navigate between menus. Due to mobile design, you need to press ESC from main menu to exit the game.Aside from fantastic visual and gameplay loop, there are few cons I found that can be problematic to new player such as transition effect of Fever mode can be bad distraction. In few songs, enemy notes in some portions doesn\u2019t sync perfectly to music beat or slightly offbeat especially on high level Master difficulty. However, you can adjust offset delay if the problem relates to your monitor. Same as background brightness if you feel like notes are blending to backdrop. Lastly, I notice register / delay problem of daily challenge at least on latest patch. Muse Dash is a rhythm game with its own identity. Solid gameplay, high replayability, and satisfying feeling of hitting beats as music enthusiast. It\u2019s something I could enjoy from hard day and share experience with friends in Discord. Wherever you\u2019re not familiar with rhythm genre or not, Muse Dash is another title that worth checking.",

                "text": "This game saved my life.I am 42.My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you",

                "text": "Muse Dash is a colourful rhythm game with a good variety in music and a satisfying gameplay loop.The game's music is overall \"Anime\", but they manage to mix it up. Some of it is more cutesy and dancey, while others take cues from jazz or swing, and others are a bit more hardcore or dubstep-y. I thought the quality of the soundtrack overall was really awesome, and I've had songs stuck in my head for weeks since playing this game.On top of that, I actually have just found myself gravitating towards playing the game a bit everyday. That's because of the great gameplay.It's simple, but has enough depth to it to make you feel cool when you nail a string of notes.So the way the game works, is you play with only two buttons. (This is because the game was initially designed as a mobile game) You press one button to attack at ground level, and one button to attack in the air. Then all you need to do is time your attacks with the notes that come your way, Guitar-Hero-style. The game mixes it up by having some held notes, some notes that turn invisible after a while, or some that have you button mash as much as possible. But the more interesting gameplay comes at the highest difficulty. There are 3 difficulties, easy, hard and master. Not all songs have all difficulties, and you need to unlock Master for every song individually, which you do by earning an S rank on Hard, which isn't as daunting as it sounds. The game does a great job at making all the notes make sense with the song, while at the same time mixing up the notes. So two verses in the song might sound identical, but play asymmetrically, and it's really interesting and fun.The game played totally fine on both my xbox 360 controller, and my keyboard. On PC controls, all keys were rebindable, while on the controller the entire left side of the controller controls one note, while the entire right side controls the other note, which I appreciated.There are scoreboards that drive you to better yourself everytime, and you can interestingly even sync up your save and scores with the mobile and PC version via online login.I really appreciated all of the options they provide you with. One of them being an \"offset\" that you can use to try and perfect your audio sync with the visuals, in case your monitor screws with that.Even more fun though, is unlocking new characters and elfins. All 3 characters have different stats that affect your scoring and playstyle, and they each have a bunch of costumes to unlock that each have their own unique and fun stats. Elfins are pets that just follow you in a level and give you passive buffs. You unlock all of this by simply playing the game and levelling up. This can be sped up by getting unique achievements per song, as well as daily tasks that refresh every 24 hours.Unfortunately, that's also the only way to unlock new songs. At some point I reached a dead end and had to go back and replay old songs before I could unlock and play newer ones. I found that a bit frustrating. Although it didn't take too long, and I would have replayed old songs anyway, it still was a bit annoying.The catchy music, great gameplay and charming aesthetic really made me fall in love with this game. A few more level designs would be great, as it can get a bit stale cycling through the same 4ish levels, but I'm hopeful they'll continue adding new content to the game following its launch, as they have in the past with the mobile version.Overall, I highly recommend the game to rhythm-game fans, it's up there as one of my favourites now.",

                "text": "This is a temporary WARNING review as the game is currently unplayable for many users. The update from 3rd of December introduced many bugs which make the game literary unplayable for many players and unpleasant to play for others. There was no fix for any of the major issues nor any sort of communication from the devs at all since the update came out.The biggest issue being that you can't play any levels, you get stuck on purple screen with music in the background and must force close the game to get out. It isn't a one time issue either, if you are affected by this bug, you can't play, period.A second very big issue you will probably experience is that key presses aren't registering properly. This includes input drops on fast presses (several enemies very close together), random delays in inputs overall (up to several seconds), hits on some enemies straight up not registering, hits not registering for some time after \"hitting air\" (pressing key when there is no enemy to be hit), combos breaking after hitting a certain enemy in some levels... These issues make it hard/impossible to play harder levels properly, but also affect simple, slow levels.  It should've never taken so long though as the issue was apparently caused because they changed the name of the folder which stores user data.In case you decide to reinstall the game hoping for it to fix the issues - it won't do anything as the update was the size of the whole game, which effectively reinstalled it for you.",

The gameplay is fairly simple once you learn the controls but each level has an amazing song to it that I just love jamming to. Some levels are fairly difficult and I find myself having to replay levels to get the trophys as I am a completionist. The characters and elfins are a fun addition and overall there are so many cool things in this game.Overall, this is one of my favourite rhythm games currently and even at the base price its WELL WORTH THE PRICE. But seriously, if you are looking for a fun game to spend time on but not be too overly invested in, you've found it!GET IT!!! ITS SO FUN!!!",

So let me recap:A female streamer shows her youtube stream analytics which show Taiwan as a country. This triggered ultra nationalist Chinese into launching an online harrasment campaign against her, which include charming things like sending death threats to her and her family, deepfaking her face on best***ity p*rn and posting it online. This has been going on for over a month now and is still happening.Now what does this have to do with this game you might ask. The puplisher has officially sided with the harrasment campaign and apparently supports this kind of behaviour.While this might not have anything to do with the game itself, remember that by buying this product you probably help funding these kind of disgusting practices.Sadly I cannot refund this since I played it more than 2 hours. Luckily I did not buy the overpriced DLC so it was only 3 bucks.",

Each character will attack all enemies it passes through and they will attack by following the rhythm of the song. There are many challenges that allow your eyes to feel dizzy. The boss will appear when the song is about to end (normally). It's easy to increase your EXP and get some stuff and characters when you finishing a song. The price of the game is very cheap (Except DLC). Even my younger sister really likes the game. She asked me to buy the Android version of the game and I have bought the Android version. Data can be synchronized via Facebook and Google. You can also customize the keyboard as you wish. The game is very comfortable to play on a low spec computer. All songs are very limited, so you have to buy DLC to be able to enjoy all the songs.  : when there are games that have a music genre, I always looking for the songs on Spotify and YouTube Music.And I thank to someone for giving me this game for free. Thank You~Yes. Anyone who likes music will definitely be interested in rhythm music games.",

                "text": "\" As you may have known what happened to Muse Dash earlier this week. I hope the players are aware of the whole situation instead of just attacking the game and leave bad reviews. Keep in mind that PeroPeroGames released a statement in Discord stating that they have nothing to do with it and they have no political stance. X.D. is the publisher and a network in China, and X.D. (\u5fc3\u52d5\u7db2\u7d61) is the company that released the statement. \" -RhythmGameMusic, YouTuber Please do not deliver the hate towards the developers of the game, and please do not bombard the reviews in a negative manner. It is reckless to show your disdain in this manner, as you are only hurting the developer and not placing blame on the publisher. It isn't as easy as to \"self publish\" a game, and we probably don't have insider knowledge as to why they simply couldn't self publish. While it is unfortunate that this transpired, please recognize that blind hatred on the store page is not the way to express yourself. Take each negative review with a grain of salt, if possible. Thank you.I originally bought the game on a small sale of about 20%, and I feel like I've been missing out on a game quite as fun as this for a while. I originally started out with an Xbox One controller, and most of the early stages are quite friendly to accommodate for players wanting to play on a controller. However, I would most definitely advise to make a transition to keyboard if you start off on a controller. Later stages and difficulties make it difficult to consistently hit your notes on time, though the ergonomic positives of playing on a controller compared to a keyboard are quite nice.As mentioned previously, this game has a diverse set of different genres in the game. From slow, low BPM songs, all the way up to the adrenaline-inducing, high BPM songs. Muse Dash has a great selection for any level of rhythm gamer, and the upfront price of the base game makes it quite an attractive rhythm game for those on a budget. Along your progression, you unlock many new songs and thus unlocking more genres and styles of songs which allows you to keep perfecting your experience as a rhythm gamer. As someone who has a history with mainly Guitar Hero, Muse Dash has great variety in the songs that are playable.Difficulty wise, I could only suggest that this game is easy only if you can get used to your control layout and get immersed into the rhythm and beat of a particular song. Having a control layout depends on different factors, but the optimal layout should be customized by the player themselves so that they can enjoy the game with relatively little problem getting used to the controls.  Rhythm and beat is difficult to get down on the first try of a song, but rhythm games are meant to be infinitely replayable and allow players to practice the song over and over until they eventually get their skill to a point they feel satisfied with. Don't feel discouraged when you do poorly on a song the first time; practice always makes perfect.Unlockables are aplenty in this game, and they can be obtained relatively easy. For every song you clear on a chosen difficulty, you receive a certain amount of experience points based on your performance and on what challenges you accomplish during your session. Early level ups offer pieces to illustrations that you can view and set as the loading screens in game, or materials that are needed to unlock different characters. After the mid level 100s, however, there will be a lack of incentive to unlock by this point unless you rely on new content that might be added in the future. But in general, unlockables are generally easy to obtain and only are cosmetic changes to your loading screens.There are three main characters, with an additional character with a single costume at the time of writing this review. The three main Muses; Rin, Buro, and Marija. Rin is the only accessible character to play with, but the rest of them can be unlocked later on with their alternate costumes also being unlockable. Every single character, along with their alt costumes, provide different skills and utilities for the player to utilize in a song. Elfins are also unlockable companions that also achieve the same uses for the characters, providing useful abilities that will be passive use in a song. Great selection of cute characters, and equally cute costumes.Honestly, watching a VTuber flex their rythmic talent in this game was enough for me to get this game and get back into a rythm game. Before a certain VTuber introduced me to this game, I have never heard of the game beforehand. After playing the game for the past 2 months, I can say that Muse Dash has been a phenomenal experience and it keeps delivering new content once per month to provide new experiences.I've been a bit caught up in trying to either Full Combo a song on its highest difficulty, or trying to aim for a spot on the leaderboards for a particular song. I didn't really think I'd take the game so seriously, but the thrill of playing a song so well can really get to you. It gets your blood pumping.I think the bottom line to why I bought Muse Dash, was because my absence from any rythm games got me interested to play Muse Dash. I'm happy to know that I can put my prior experiences to good use in this game. I'm really loving this game and all the favorited songs I replay. The base game of Muse Dash allows access to one full album of music, around 52 songs in total. For the DLC to cost 10 times as much as the base game, which is $3, seems like a skeptical purchase to some people. Even if you did the math to account for each unique song added from the DLC compared to the base game's 52-or-so songs, the DLC would only come up to around $13 in value when you compare song-to-count ratio (52 base songs: 227 DLC songs) . It is a steep purchase, and you essentially have to buy the DLC to experience the rest of the game's content. I would only recommend purchasing this DLC if you either can part ways with $30, or you could find the DLC on sale at any discount possible. But, the DLC has a ton more music to include and will always be added onto whenever the developers add in new albums with an update. So, kinda up to you if you can dedicate yourself to even more songs.+ Muse Dash is a big recommend from me. As a long-time casual rhythm gamer, Muse Dash was an easy pick-up for me to start playing.+ Play on either keyboard or with controller, whichever works for you.+ Music genres and choices are really good, and there is certain to be a song you'll return to whenever you boot the game up.+ Good unlockables, making the experience more fulfilling for players wanting a lot of content with their game on top of the base game.+/- DLC has a ton more content to play with, but a retail price of $30 makes it difficult to fully recommend it.- The \"V-Sync\" setting for refresh rates may hinder your chances of getting big combos, as there have been reports of the setting being prone to interruptions during gameplay. Additionally, the game may desync with the audio and obviously can cause players frustrations in keeping with the rhythm.[/b]",

                "text": "Muse Dash offers a cute and vibrant art style to go along with a simple and addicting two button style gameplay. The game has three base characters to choose from that you will unlock costumes and companions for in a token style system as you play. During songs you have to hit and avoid things on either the top or bottom plane as you continually run. There are three difficulties you can choose from for most songs allowing for you to enjoy regardless of your skill. There is a fair amount of varied content content in the songs and as you can probably tell from the store page where this game really shines is it's cutesy design and vibrant color scheme. Honestly the only gripe I have isn't anything major or deserved. There is a lot of content locked behind a paywall. At first it was 20 songs you would unlock if you bought it from what I remember seeing but there are even more songs added now. I've read how some would prefer to have a steam workshop but it may be hard to keep the charm and design over custom added songs. The dlc price is a bit steep but it's probably worth if you enjoy the game and they keep cranking out content. Just clearing the base content of this game took me around four hours and I'll probably go back to it every once in a while. I hope to be able to pick up the dlc one day and experience everything this game has to offer and I hope they continue to add more content. For now if you enjoy rhythm games; I can easily recommend Muse Dash for the base price seeing the great content you get. \ud835\udd40\ud835\udd57 \ud835\udd50\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd66 \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udd5f\ud835\udd5b\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd6a \ud835\udd4b\ud835\udd59\ud835\udd5a\ud835\udd64 \ud835\udd4b\ud835\udd63\ud835\udd6a",

                "text": "This game is actually good. Jumping into it, I did not really know what to expect from it but I ended up being very pleasantly surprised. The tutorial was quick and to the point, and while it doesn't exactly explain that you can use 2 keys for both ground and air, it does its job at explaining how the game works.The characters, while few, have interesting variations that spice up the gameplay with their own unique abilities, suggestiveness not withstanding.But if I could draw any parallels to this game, it would be Taiko no Tatsujin or osu!taiko if you're an osu! player. Believe me, if you've played either of those games (or both), jumping into this will be no problem. You'll make yourself right at home, especially if you're an osu!taiko player that plays with the kkdd scheme.There are gripes with the game I have though, such as some songs rhythmically feeling like they don't really highlight what the player expects, leading to me just mashing for the most part and hope I get it right, but so far - it's been a blast.In 3 hours I managed to reach Level 45 and unlock almost all of the free tracks but I will definitely come back to this in the future, either to finish unlocking everything or just to play for fun.tl;drDo you want an anime-styled Taiko no Tatsujin for cheap? Muse Dash is for you!",

                "text": "+ Colorful environments with flashy characters,+ Music tends to go along the aesthetics of the game. It is energetic, classy and dynamic.+ There is a good number of mobs to crush, from enemies having different models to bosses.+ The game price is relatively low for the quality it presents. Characters have animations and are rich in detail.+ The sound effects are not an extra or queue for notes, instead, they complement the songs in the game.+ Lots of replayability with DLC songs. Some of them are free rewards once the player reaches a certain level.- The game starts very easy, which can be boring for some players.- Leaderboard requires a sign in into your google account in order to post your score.- Since the game is flashy and features vivid colors, playing on a room that it is not bright enough can be a bother.Muse Dash is a hybrid-rhythm game that successfully combines the elements of side-scroller with the fast-paced beats of a music game. It also features a lot of quality when it comes to details in its final product, as characters have their own animations and look. Enemies do as well, as the variety of mobs and bosses add a rich layer to the game as well as a vibe that goes between comedy and cuteness. In Muse Dash, players must hit musical beats which are featured as a sort of elements. These can range from robots to lollipops or starts. As they beat these notes, hazardous elements such as enemies traps or bosses that will spawn to obstruct the player progress and eventually create a sort of mini showdown after which they will retire. Early levels start off easy as a sort of practice mode, while later ones can be hard to beat on higher difficulties. There are three characters in the game, these are Rin, Buro, and Marija. Each of these characters has different costumes that each possess their own effects and will affect gameplay. For example, default Marija will make it so that when a combo is under 100, missing a note won't break the combo while default Buro becomes invincible during fever mode. These can be stacked with Elfin effects. Elfins are little creatures that will help the players by giving them more fever time, reducing damage and more.Fever mode is activated when the player fills up the fever gauge. This can be done quickly by successfully maintaining a combo. While in fever mode, notes give more score and the visuals change to reflect an even more energetic style. Fever mode can also be used to recover some health if enemies with hearts show up.Songs have a number below them in each difficulty. This number indicates how hard it is to beat the song on the said setting. The first songs are extremely easy, even on hard which will result in lots of full combos(perfects). However, once the player reaches lv 25-30, songs will start to become more challenging, especially on master difficulty. So, for those of you who enjoy those insane notes being stacked together, don't worry, they are in the game.What makes Muse Dash so singular is that it really goes out of its way with the aesthetics. Every element seems to complement each other rather than being the result of an addition. The characters are flashy, the enemies have lots of models featuring cute and fun themes, the songs are energetic, the visuals are vivid and the bosses show-up in style. It is like watching the game put on a show while playing it.Every detail is executed with the utmost cared. From Buro's facial expressions when she hits notes to costumes and sound. The songs are fast paced but the rhythm is always present and new enemies keep getting added as the player progresses through the song list. This quality resembles a certain extent, that of a AAA game.I would recommend players to play on hard mode, and then move to master. This way there is a learning curve of sorts for each song, while also adding some complexity to the gameplay. It can be sort of boring at first, but it gets much better later in the game.There are also multiple stages, from cities filled with robotic enemies to candy islands filled with pink palettes to a factory in space. The stages are a nice touch and they can keep the game from getting repetitive, as having the same background for all songs would be detrimental. The enemy models can vary in the same stage, this means that sometimes you can see certain types of enemies while in another song the mobs will be different, even if the stage is the same one.The game runs like butter. Most systems should be getting 100-200 frames with ease. Muse Dash is a game that can be both fun and entertaining to watch, and you are getting much more than your money's worth with the quality present here. The only thing I didn't like so much is that rather than featuring its own leaderboard, it borrows it from google which might look a little cheap.What makes this game special is that it does manage to keep the player attention after multiple sessions. Usually, a rhythm game will be bought and eventually forgotten, but Muse Dash makes the player come back to it whenever it is because of the side-scroller elements, it\u2019s aesthetics or the characters commenting on the main menu. It is a rhythm game that tries to soar among its peers by adding lots of little details.What also makes this special is how fun it is. Smacking enemies to the rhythm of a song can be great for casual fun and some enjoyment. At the same time, getting that full combo or aiming for a place in the scoreboard can be challenging, this invites the player to revisit songs they had already cleared, and with the mixes of its elements, it becomes something to look forward rather than a task.Muse Dash is a fantastic game that features lots of elements, mixes them together and keeps elevating them. Its strongest point is it\u2019s a presentation, everything looks nice and rich in detail. The song list is pretty good and it's always funny to see how the characters speak to the player on screen. This is a game that was put effort into it, and it was worth to do so based on the attention it has been getting. I recommend this to all players who want to try a rhythm game but don't feel too sure and to everyone who enjoys this kind of games.",

I can wholeheartedly say this is a good one, a great one even. From the very beginning it just felt GOOD to play it. Inputs are tight, responsive. Feels amazing. Playing and succeeding is extremely satisfying. Song choice is also very good with a nice variety(you will get dubstep, funkot, generic edm, eurobeat, poppy vocaloid songs and more). If you are a fan of rhythm games- this one is a must. Very fun and addictive. If you are a veteran used to playing the highest difficulty in your music games don't expect too much of a challenge though, you will probably unlock all the songs in about 5 hours of game play like I did. But you can always get DLC for many other great songs which I definitely recommend. You may find the DLC price a bit high but I would say it's worth every penny since the song library is absolutely massive.Also- Muse Dash is best played with a controller. Trust me on that.",

                "text": "TL;DR: The game plays out well, and the music is addicting. Characters, costumes, Elfins, and songs will continue to be put out for this game, which is really neat. For people who are still on the edge for buying the DLC songs, I am almost 100% sure that when they release new song packs, those songs will be included in the DLC; It sort of acts as a Season Pass. Absolutely get this game, and if you can afford it, get the DLC as well.This game is a total blast to play. People may turn away from it's simplistic controls and it's limited 2 lane mechanics, but the feeling of nailing a combo and popping that Fever at just the right time is just amazing. And the characters you play also add up to that experience, with each of them having unique animations for their personalities.The characters that they introduce are not only cute, but each costume that they get have certain abilities, such as increased Fever bar gain, or more health per pick-up. There is even a costume that lets you watch a perfect run of the song. There are also Elfins, little pets that you can bring during your song in order to give you another special ability to use.The only downside to this, is the way you obtain these characters and Elfins. You start off with one character and no Elfins, and as you level up, you collect items that will unlock a specific character/Elfin. Each character/Elfin needs 8 specific items to be obtained. This can become a grind, and after a while, you'll be replaying the songs you can do in order to gain the exp to level up. But you can see this as a positive too; at least they didn't hide any of the characters behind a paywall. (At least, from when I'm posting this.)The songs are very mixed, actually. Some are vocaloid, some are instrumental, and some are just regularly sung songs in Japanese or Chinese. These are actually pretty nice songs, and fit perfectly with the type of game this is. In the base game, they start off easy, and continually become harder and harder to complete, which helps players visualise their progress in something more than just unlocking songs.Unlocking songs works kind of in the same way that unlocking characters does, but instead of having to obtain items, it is directly linked to your level. Songs are unlocked each level until a point, then are unlocked every two levels. (Final one is an exception, needing 5 more levels after the previous song.) I only had to replay a song once or twice in order to unlock a few of the songs, which was nice. But the variety in songs gave me enough experience in order to expand my knowledge on this games mechanics.All in all, a very solid game, worthy of its praise so far. Keep up the good work guys.",

A supremely satisfying rhythm game for beginners and veterans alike, with tight controls, good song selection, and great art and sound design.If you're interested, get it. It's $3 and you'll know long before the 2-hour refund window whether it's something you'll want to keep (Spoiler alert: you will). There are plenty of songs to enjoy even without the DLC, and the game isn't predatory with its unlocks. Anything that's unlockable via level-up, I acquired just by playing and enjoying the game, without feeling pressured to buy the DLC for its XP boost. At the time of this review, I've played for 17 hours on the cheap version, and I'm thrilled to be buying the DLC purely for the love of the game, and not because I felt like I needed it to enjoy the base content fully.Best rhythm game I've played in years. You need this in your life.",

There are genuine reasons why you shouldn't buy this game.If you own 2k21, this is a carbon copy of it.This is current gen. Don't believe what some of these people saying about current gen 2k22 that it's the same as next gen with graphics being the only difference. WRONG!The entire game is damn near different. Most important difference of all? MyPlayer creation. The badges are COMPLETELY different from next gen. We get the same system as we had in 2k21, while the next gen have a completely different badge system. We get the same labels, sure, but the way you get them? 100% different.Your build? 100% different. Here you still get the pie-charts, in next-gen it's a whole different game.And not to mention the graphics obviously.So literally there are only 3 differences between this, and 2k21.1-The name.2-The roster (which can be updated, so even this don't really count).3-Some new badges, but the same old system.Do not buy this not because of a 2k boycott. Not because of 2k being greedy. Not because of principle or whatever.Don't buy this literally because it's the same as 2k21. I don't even mean this in a \"ooh it's the same game every year\" no. I mean literally the same. I had to alt-tab just to make sure I was in 2k22, and not 2k21.If your friends have this, and you wanna get it or whatever, go ahead. But I 100% recommend you either get 2k21 on a discount if you gonna play that singleplayer, or just get the game on consoles.IF you're playing MyTeam however? That's fine, go ahead.",

The individual games themselves are fun and the franchise is deep with tons of customization for your franchise. Even MyPlayer can be fun in certain aspects. Each simulation game feels fun, and it's truly the best simulation of the NBA out there right now. The reason I can't suggest this game is because it's the same as previous years. It all feels the same. The franchise mode might as well be copy and paste, with most features being the exact same. Even the new map in the MyPlayer feels pointless because even with a different layout it's almost exactly the same locations. Do not bother buying this game if you have any 2K from 2K16 to 2K21. You aren't getting anything new out of this game you can't get from them.",

The biggest problem I have besides the stripping of features compared to the xbox x/ps5 titles is the disgusting amount of ads in it. When I purchase a $60 game there shouldn't be extra advertising in the game itself. Its tactless and a pure money grab.",

Basically Cyberpunk 2077 for sports, based on all the hype around it. You are absolutely wrong, my friend. This game was done ONLY for next-gen consoles. This isn't even a new game for PC. Comparing it to Cyberpunk 2077 like I did, doesn't do it justice, because I enjoyed Cyberpunk on PC. Yes it had bugs, but it was a beautiful game. NBA 2k22 is basically 2k21 with worse shot meter which you can't really see in some situations as it may appear on the characters left or right. Not like the one above you was a standardized approach which you knew where to find all the time and didn't need to lean onto the monitor to look for it. Then comes the Career mode. It's ridiculous. The first game is made difficult only for 2K to force you to buy VC to actually enjoy the storyline and get the best of it. So if you're newer to the game and you didn't invest VC to boost your character from 60 overall to sometihng like 80 or so... Well, let's just say that ALT+F4 will become a close friend of yours before you pass that first college game test. Rest of the games are easy thereafter, which makes perfect sense, because you're going to top 16, top8, semis and final and it doesn't get more difficult there, but rather counter-intuitively - becomes somewhat easier. If this weren't enough, the game is sooooo much 2k21 that your mycareer character is sometimes  ffsIs there anything that I found better than 2K21? Absolutely not. It's not optimized either, as it randomly lags in online 3v3 games with annoying stutterings all around. Waste of money and moreover a huge annoyance, as you 'upgraded' and going back to 2k21 doesnt make much sense either",

I was recently banned by 2k for breaking terms of service. I was never given what term of service i broke. I've been a legit player forever. I am a hardcore player who never cheats or glitches in any game. I grinded 50 hours over the course of this week because i do this yearly with every single 2k. I take off of work on release day and i play 2k for hours. One week after release, i was banned and 2ksupport has told me that i broke TOS and that i will not be unbanned. I bought the legends edition for 100 dollars because i log hundreds of hours yearly and its always an investment i enjoy. After years of thinking this, im ready to go on record and say that 2k does not give a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about their player base. They do not give a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about their PC community and they do not give a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about you. I'd love to give this game a great review because they make fun games with a good amount of content that i always enjoy and this year seemed (so far) that it was going to be considered one of the better 2K's in recent years. 2K has been a part of my childhood up until my adult life and i am still in disbelief that this has happened. I've requested a refund for the 100 dollars i spent that hopefully they will send back. If you look at 2kSupport on Twitter, apparently this has happened to quite a few people. It seems like i somehow must have unknowningly done something so egregious that i was never given a 7 day ban or anything like that, they went straight to an entire ban from 2k22. So if you want to play a game that provides fun gameplay but is also completely ready to \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 on your chest at a moments notice, 2k22 is the game for you. Don't do what i did and disregard the reviews. 2k has horrible reviews for a reason. 2k has even worse reviews on steam for a bigger reason. Thank you and Buyer Beware.",

Well I can tell you that in my opinion it's worth it if you enjoy the game. Here's why....1. More to do. Quests have been added which gives you stuff to do and aim for.2. Loading times have been extremely reduced and are so much faster.3. The game runs smoother and I aim even able to play with a higher graphics setting.4. Most players have moved on to 22 so there are move players to play with.5. I actually get REC games now. (There does seem to be peak hours though)6. They got rid of Shot Aiming (I hated it anyways)7. Gameplay IMO seems smoother.8. Improved new Badge system which so far seems to work for me.9. New MyCareer story to play which I give a 7/1010. VC seems to be a tiny bit easier to get and grind than on the previous version.So all in all it's not as bad as many would have you believe, they're all mostly just peeved that we don't have the next gen. Yes it sucks, yes it's dumb, but it is what it is. There's still enough new content here to keep you busy if you ask me.",

Multiplayer is recommended to be played on console.It's a crazy game where you can't beat them unless you're a cheater, so a detailed evaluation doesn't make any sense anymore.Again, NBA 2K PC is S_H_I_T now!! There are also a lot of nonsensical bugs.The bottom line is that those who only play single player should buy it cheaply later.",

The shot meter is completely JANKED, literally you will never make a shot unless you green every shot (f*** sitting in training to learn how to green 30% of my shots). I doubt any casual player will do that. Not only is the shooting complete trash, but the ai does everything with ease. Even on lower difficulties you can't ever get the AI to peel off you, and yet when the roles are reversed (you on d and AI playing O) they blow right by you like you're a kid with downs in a f**k**g wheelchair.

Starting in the beginning of the year and for the first time having my own money to spend on a game i went a bit overboard with the first 3 special packs they dropped over all 3 i dropped more than 500$ and thats not including the 100$ special edition. in the middle of me buying packs on 9/18 at 2 am i got banned due to opening packs. I mean i cant find out what else its for as i only ever played 1 MT online game...... \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 fantastic isnt it? but thats not it folks it gets better, reaching out to 2k support they took MULTIPLE days to respond at least 6 only to tell me they elevated the ban to the dev team and i would hear back in 5-7 days on the appeal sentance. I still havent heard \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, not only that my bank wont work with me to get this money back so im out 600$+ and i cant even play with all the characters i bought. this company is so bad i feel like i would be doing anyone wrong by not posting this review ive played 2k on pc for the past 3 years and never had this issue but its always never been taken care of on PC and its obvious. such a terrible game and company I spit on anyone who works there and hope i get to see 2k fall like they will watch the money slowly drain from their pockets as they so uncaringly bled the pockets of their fans they will bleed their own pockets of their childrens fortunes and it will be no ones mishap but their own as all that goes around comes around. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 2k!!!!!",

Next gen can only be found on the latest xbox and playstation consoles which i refuse to buy cuz i have a nice gaming PC. The next gen version appears to be much better in many ways.  i would be fine with this old gen version i guess but the biggest issue is just getting in games and cheaters. on PC there are an absolute ton of people who did the badge hack where for example you have 7' glass cleaner that has every badge on HOF so he can dribble, shoot, contact dunk, speed boost, steel the ball and get every rebound. its a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 show. it doesnt seem that 2k really spends any effort eliminating this on PC so that is just part of this game. to the point where 2k may as well just unlock everything for everyone. cuz u need to run the hack to play against these guys. and there is a lot of them. the other issue is just getting in a game. the player base is nowhere near as large as console so finding a rec game that doesnt lag out takes forever at times. and in park people have the same typical 2k bs where they for some reason are afraid to lose and play one game with someone who may suck based on their overall and clothes i guess. so they stand around and do nothing instead. you can look up peoples win % but its sort of a pain. ive always thought that silly how much people care about this. the game resets every year and you have to buy a new one pretty much. oh also, no comms on pc. on PC you would have to go find the person on steam and add them to your friends. there is no quick link between steam and 2k servers at all. you would have to screen shot or write down their name, and go search them to add them manually. otherwise you literally have no communication in writing or mic with anyone on 2k. thats absolutely insane. the PC version is a very lazy version of 2k where anything that would require effort to adjust to make work for PC, was just ditched all together. i would have been better off grabbing my old xbox out of storage basically. i just got sick of paying $10/mo for xbox live to play one game. In the end, i paid for it knowing it would be a bit \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 but i really love basketball and this is the only legit option.",

                "text": "this is worse than 2k21 and even that one wasn't very good. lets get the big concern with PC players out of the way first. NEXT GEN, it sucks that PC doesn't get all the features that console does. they act like they don't have the money to add the features we deserve. especially for $60. i tried to refund it but i was 15 min past the 2 hour mark and they wouldn't honor it so thanks Stream for that. Now, that I got that out of the way, i have other major reasons why i don't like this game.1.     this is my biggest problem i have with this game and it revolves around the MYCAREER NBA part.         the story is eh, I mean your nickname in this is \"MP\". they were so lazy they just called you My Player.         why did they even do a story line if they weren't going to put ANY effort in it? the CPU gameplay is bad,         most of feels just like last years and nothing seems touched.... EXCEPT.... the other team almost never         misses and your team is the biggest pile of steamy crap you've even seen. I got drafted to the warriors         and Curry and Thompson and Wiggins and Green are so bad that i became a starter in 6 games. i         average 10 APG and that's me passing to the bench players. how are players rated in the 90s and high         80s worse than me, a 79? 2.     now i have to talk about the neighborhood. I've never been a huge fan of it but i will say the latency isn't         there anymore so they get points for that. BUT when i play rec games and if the game is over or people         leave the lobby before the game loads, then i have to ALT F4 and reload the game cause im stuck. And         then there's the different levels just to get somewhere, its very annoying. I get what they were doing,         but i feel it's unnecessary. it would be nice to have some sort of matchmaking system so you can play         with people your level other than that, it's the same thing every year but i give it credit in places.i would not recommend buying this game. if you have 2k21 and don't care about the neighborhood just play that. you're not missing anything and i think you'll enjoy yourself more anyway.",

Was wondering why my badge wouldnt go on, I realized the servers were down. No problem I restarted my game, only to find that I had been banned for \"Violating terms of service\"- Which is obviously impossible because for some reason theres no way to talk to the community, find new friends to play with as you cant find them on steam \"in current game\". I have messaged 2k support to get my error ban sorted, however they said it may take 2-3 weeks, not only does this mean I cant play, I cant collect my daily rewards which i have done daily since release, I cant complete my daily quests, I am unable to start my rebirth build because I will miss the mission and guess what, I miss the whole 3 quarters of the season so I will miss out on loads of rewards for the current season, all because of the lack of game optimisation. Im scared that I wont even get unbanned as I have heard stories of people saying that they didnt get their account back and the ban appeal is up to admins (i agree with if there was an actual violation of terms of service) however in my circumstance I am being punished for 2K's mistakes. Stating all this, I will not lie to you. I have had some real good times and some good laughs with my friends on game modes such as pro-am, our record is 4-40 because we suck and often get matched with 3- 99 overall players whilst we are mid 80s (matchmaking sucks). Im not sure whether to recommend you this game or for you to never spend money on a 2K ever. Me and my friends say that this was the worst purchase we've made ever, and that we wont buy 2k23, but we all know deep down that we probably will buy it again next year because of how \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and funny this game is. When/if i get unbanned, I will post back on here and talk about their customer service and appeal system, but if I dont get unbanned I am not sure what to do as I have technically been scammed/robbed. I'm sure that 2K arent that corrupt to keep bans on people that were error bans but ill let you know. All in all, this game is fun, it is a video game after all. But dont expect high quality matchmaking, game optimisation or for the devs to care about you because thats not what this game prides itself on. Buy VC if you want, I was going to purchase \u00a340 worth but now I'm a little scared in-case that something goes wrong.",

Also i have not played a single online game. Its sad that i spend money on this franchise for over 10 years and this is how they treat their loyal customer base. More than likely i will not receive a refund because i have just over 2 hours played. If you cant properly manage your game at least learn to not steal from people. If i dont receive a full refund i will be going NUCLEAR on steam and 2k sports,",

Blatant cheaters with 9 ft arms, 99's in 92 and below lobbies, people with every badge in the game on Hall of Fame that dominate games.

With how generous cygames is, having a viable ladder deck takes no time, and the gameplay isn't who gets the better RNG. There's lots of skill and counterplay, and TL;DR I highly reccomend this game if you like CCG's. That being said, the game does have its problems:Power Creep: the devs have stated they want this card game to be very high-powered, but balance is still important. I feel they still have a few lessons to learn in regards to card design and balance, and I'm very curious to see what the game will look like in a few years.Art Style: I'm really not a fan of anime, and the in-your-face sexuality gets to me. Some of the art is really cool, but if this game ever wants to reach a bigger audience, this probably has to be addressed. Don't play this game at workValue of Real-World Money: I'm the U.S., so this will be written with that in mind. The value of purchasing packs with IRL currency is extremely poor. The daily deal is great, but most people who want packs want to crack them here and now, myself included. Currently, there's a deal for what is essentially 76 packs for $80 USD, which I feel should be the default price, with like 100 packs for $80 being a good deal. This IS offset by cygames giving out free packs like pedos give out candy, but still.These cons are, I feel, heavily offset by the pros of the game. Very fun and unique gameplay, generous devs (have I mentioned this enough yet? Coming from Hearthstone this was such a huge, huge difference), quick balance updates, and card design that makes even control mirrors take no time makes this game one of the best digital CCGs on the market. Definitely a game to watch for the next few years, especially if the competition (read: Blizzard) continues to treat its customers like garbage.",

The game is able to provide all of this without the need to spend money.I have been playing this game since June 15th, 2016 and my biggest fear was needing to cash in to keep up with the meta. Thankfully, I never felt the need to spend money!The catch? Just log in every day and do your daily quests and in 3 months you could gain a whopping  rupees! That's 100 packs! That's 800 cards! In a month they give out 640 rupees + 6 free packs + 2 Arena tickets just for logging in!Maintenance extended? BAM. 5 more free packs!Special events? The new year's event alone gave everyone 1100 rupees (11 packs) just for logging in! For the one year anniversary they gave away a whopping 40 packs!New expansion? 10 free packs!New player? It varies, but you are guaranteed at least 30+ packs just for creating an account!Defeating Elite AI? Seven different classes, 200 rupees each. 1400 rupees!? When will the generosity END?What? Private matches with unique players give you 100 each? YOU CAN DO THIS 20 TIMES? 2000 RUPEES?Playing story gives you rupees (280 rupees)? Ascending ranks gives you rupees(100 each)? Arena runs gives you packs and rupees?You're guaranteed a pack even if you lose all 5 matches in areYOU CAN REROLL ACCOUNTS FOR BETTER LEGENDARIES? (Actually important, pls research more about rerolling)How can a game be so generous? Is it failing? Is that why they give away so many free things?. Shadowverse is originally a Japanese mobile game, the mobile game market in Japan is  competitive. Shadowverse in Japan is massively popular and even has TV commercials! You don't need to worry about the future of Shadowverse.Now, just talking about the generosity makes me run out of breath. Onto the most important part of a good game.Is the game fun?Yes! That is my answer. Why?Whoops, I guess I should start formatting a little better, right? Sigh. Sorry for hurting your eyes! Please bear with me. . .Whoaaaaa, it's been a while since I played story.Uhhhh, there's 7 different classes with 10+ missions each! Heh, I'm not going to spoil it though!  (It's also voiced in English/Japanese/---Korean.)Before playing multiplayer I *highly* recommend finishing all of the story to get a feel for all the different classes. All the free stuff is great and the story provides vital cards that are actually meta in ranked play.   A little joke for veterans of the game ;)This is also where you pick your favorite class! Every single craft can hit B3 rank with no real problems, just have fun and learn how to play the game! Though be wary of jumping into A rank, meta decks rule from then on!Unranked is the land of meme decks, all the non-competitive worthy decks roam the lands of unranked just to try to fish out the hilarious (usually inconsistent) win from their off-meta deck. This is also a great place to finish your daily quests for those sweet sweet rupees!Ooo, ranked play. A daunting task awaits you...not really. Everyone is considered a noobie until they hit A rank (others debate the real game begins in AA rank). The ranks are as follows: D, C, B, A, AA, MastersAlso, in Master rank they give out rewards to the top 10000, 1000, and 100.\"To arms, there is a battle underway!\"I'm no expert of Take Two, but it's sure a fun gamemode! 30 card decks that is made through tough decisions in the drafting. Costs 150 rupees to enter and you can surely make those rupees back and run off with a card pack as well! This is where you can build up to 27 different decks! You want to make more than 27 different decks? There's also the official Shadowverse portal that lets you store up to 200 different decks! There's also a neat deck code function that instantly puts together an entire deck that you   found online!The cards page holds your entire collection of cards and also has filters for you to look through certain crafts. You can also view the art more closely AND listen to the delicious voices of certain cards ;)There are leader skins for each craft, all of them costing 2800 rupees/gems! Or just 500 for each. I recommend getting Vampy-chan because nobody likes Urias buuu.All the card sleeves in the store are free! The better sleeves are usually obtained through rank rewards of hitting 4,000 and 12,000 ranked score.Each pack has 8 cards, with the pull rates that follow:With 4, soon 5, different places to pull from, I recommend doing a little research on what legends are staples in meta decks. The general rule is that standard packs are the best packs for new players due to the best legendaries being the standard packs. Please refer to REROLLING guides.It's fun to pull, but I don't recommend spending money to pull...(more on that later)You can fight with your friends! Test out decks and what-not. Streamers could even open up rooms and fight against their viewers if they really wanted to. You can also practice in Take Two formatted matches!Many players at this current time are very concerned about the state of the game where each expansion there is a feeling of a \"powercreep.\" While this feeling may be prevalent, people just need to remember that each craft has a certain counter. If a craft does not have a counter, Cygames goes out of their way and makes really detailed meta reports and nerfs the appropiate cards. Bad UI. (It's a direct mobile game port)Censors + Lack of changing voice settings.Expensive Gems. ($80 for 5000 gems)Japan exclusive offers.

If you come from games like yugioh, Magic or even Hearthstone, you will have a real blast with this game. To clear up some of the negativ comments i red which are just untrue, I decided to write a review myself. 1. You cant play in fullscreen.    - Yes you can, just go to the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 settings and click on \"Fullscreen\" 2. You cant play the game with japanese voices while having english text.    - Yes you can, just google it \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. It isnt even that difficult. 3. You cant play the game in 60 fps.    - Yes you can, just go to the settings and choose \"60 fps\". 4. The game is P2W   - No it isnt. It is true you need cardpacks to get new cards, but just by playing the game      you will get rewarded with countless of packs.       You will be rewarded for playing the game, regardles what you play, Ranking up, leveling up, achieving something.        Everything will be rewarded with something. You have 3 daylies a day which give more than one pack at some time.       Just by completing the storymode, you get about 20 packs. You dont have to pay a cent to get a good deck together. 5. You auto-lose if you go first, because the guy who gets second has 1 evo-point more and draws an extra card at turn 1.     - No, you actually need these as the second player to counter the first players push. The first player is always one turn      ahead and besieges you with stronger minions. As the second player you must somehow defend against that, so you       have one more evo-point ... no \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 big deal. 6. The game has no future, because the Devs dont care about it.      - Never read something so stupid. I actually am absolutely positivly surprised by the care the devs give to the         playerbase. They very regularily give free packs for special occasions. Additionally they just released         a new expansion and got this game from mobile only to steam. What the hell do you want more? If you dont like the anime style of the game, you cant be helped. I would just be sad for you to never have tried this awesome TCG (or CCG, because you cant actually trade) Hope some of you dont let you decieve by stupid people who cant even figure out how to fine the settings in this game.",

                "text": "This review is complicated to write for me and even harder to choose if I recommend or not so I've broken it down into two categories:1. Are you looking for a fun 10-20 hours of getting generous amounts of cards, the ability to build pretty much any deck you want completely f2p and enjoying an anime artstyle with interesting mechanics? Then yes, I recommend this game.2. Are you looking for a competitive in-depth card game where at the higher levels of play unique decks are possible and there's always a niche for creativity? Then no, I do not recommend this game. Since this is what I personally enjoy I'm putting this recommendation as No as a result.This wasn't always the case, I have 650 hours on this game for a reason. In the beginning Shadowverse was widely accepted to be horribly unbalanced and there were very clear good decks and bad decks. Then around the end of 2017 they released a new faction and something called Rotation mode. In this mode they simply only had in play the five most recent expansions. This allowed all the cards people had a problem with that dominated the meta to slowly be \"rotated out\".By late 2018 they had rotated out all of the \"problem cards\" and this was by far the best time to play Shadowverse. At this point my favorite class \"Swordcraft\" was considered to be the lowest tier in the game and I still enjoyed the game and climbed to the highest rank on the competitive ladder using unique decks and synergizing weird effects. At this point I roped in every friend I could find and put a bunch of money into the game even though f2p is 100% viable just because I wanted to support the development of the game.However this all changed when the fire nation attacked. Ehehe, just kidding but when the game was at its most balanced and there were no clear winners or losers Cygame released the \"Rebirth of Glory\" expansion in the middle of 2019. This expansion reintroduced a lot of the \"overpowered\" problem cards that everyone had issues with and ever since then there are very clear meta defining decks and cards and anything else became unplayable in high level play.Unfortunately rather than scaling back after a lot of community outcry, they continued to release even stronger cards in every expansion in attempt I can only speculate to be \"If everyone is special, then no one is special\". Unfortunately this just meant that mixing esoteric card effects were no longer anywhere near as effective as the overpowered cards they printed specifically to counteract the Pandora's box they opened. After playing through 3 expansions in the hope some semblance of the game I fell in love with would return, I finally stopped playing. I haven't given up completely and still return every expansion and look at the meta in the hopes that things have changed, but it's been 2 years now.",

                "text": "Alright seeing there's a lot of nonsense negative review I'll chime in to address a lot of misconceptions to those bad review. I find it annoying to see so many negative reviews with so little understanding of how the game even works (like giving a negative review just because they don't know how to mute the music in 2019, what the actual f- ?). I dunno if they're just memeing or actually serious but here's an  you should read about the game made by someone who played this game for a long time.  Absolutely not! With enough time and some grind, you can craft all the card you need. There's no exclusive card/feature you can buy with real money. The only worthwhile things you can buy with real money are cosmetics and pre-built deck which is an option if you want to immediately jump-start your card collection. Once again, these thing doesn't affect the gameplay and only there if you want to ease up your grind to get those key cards.Everyone is on the same playing field with game knowledge (i.e class matchup) being your real show of skill.Shadowverse is one of the best F2P CCG out there. Out of the gate, you're given one of each legendary card that exists up to Steel Rebellion expansion (looking at you  person). On top of that, you also get 50 free packs (10 packs from 5 of the latest expansion) after you're done with the tutorial. This will immensely help your card collection to create a lot of useable budget deck immediately. There's also a lot of in-game events such as collab and tournament that will easily net you in-game currencies if you just log in and play for a few hours. Heck, they even introduce a temporary card system that allows you to create a useable legendary card you need from now on. Lastly, there's daily mission you can do and clearing this will easily net you AT LEAST a pack/day.No, far from that. There's no high win RNG play you should worry in this game. The closest is probably a card named Truth Adjudication but even that is tied to how well you pilot the deck before playing said card. Anybody who relies on that card as a win-con is just asking for trouble.Keep in mind a little bit of RNG is okay since it makes the game unpredictable sometimes and Shadowverse is in the fine balance of it.Since there are two main formats in this game I'll address it in their respective format. But before we start , the dev  makes a monthly balance when they think needed. Sometimes they don't do it because their in-house data about win and pick rate doesn't support it but if that's the case then they will at least inform you about it. If it gets  the dev doesn't afraid to make emergency balance before the month ended. Now then...Rotation is a format where you can only use cards from the five newest sets. This is probably the most balanced format since the dev has better control over the meta. All cards in this format usually fall in-line in power with a few cards slightly above the other which is fine. Every deck needs some strong cards to be relevant after all.     Unlimited is a format where you can use ALL the card that exists in the game. Now as you can imagine, this is a tricky one to balance because with so many cards in the poll you can't expect a perfect balance in here. But because every class has access to it every class can be as powerful as they can be so that will balance itself.I'm not a fan of this format but as they say, when everything is broken nothing is broken.Alright, I think that's all the main point for now. If you have any more question feel free to ask it in the comment section. You can decide yourself to trust me on this one or all these nonsense negative reviews about the game. Shadowverse is a fine game and I think you should give it a chance if you're looking for an anime-style CCG. --------Some extra resource you can look if you want to know more / get started.  > New Player Guide from Reddit> A Public Shadowverse Discord Server",

                "text": "I highly recommend this game. I've read quite a few reviews criticising this game for its overly heavy RNG, and its \"pay to win\" nature, and i disagree.I picked up this game during TOTG (Tempest of the Gods, the latest expansion), and I've loved every minute of it (much more than 20 hours worth as this game lets you play on the same account on mobile). I especially enjoy the evolve mechanic, which allows the tempo of any given match to swing back and forth. The art is also gorgeous, although some may certainly disagree. And thats fine, because art is inherently subjective. But lets tackle the two big criticisms mentioned above.Overly heavy RNG: There's undoubtedly RNG in any card game. The main issue is the extent to which RNG affects the game, or the user experience. In shadowverse, apart from the inherently luck-based nature of card draws, there are indeed some cards like Jolly Rogers (who randomly gains 1 of 3 effects whenever he's summoned) that are heavily RNG based, but the presence of a few cards that rely on RNG doesnt render the game unplayable, or even bad. It gives the game diversity. If the majority or a substantial number of cards operate on such a basis, then there would certainly be good reason for this criticism. But there isnt.\"Pay to win\" nature of the game: Lets put this upfront, there are powerful legendary cards in this game. If you put them in direct comparison with other non-legendary cards, they certainly look stronger. But to argue that the game is pay to win is simply ridiculous. Many legendary cards are expensive (in terms of mana cost to play), and take time to set up. They can also often be removed by various cards that outright destroy, banish, or transform enemy followers. You can play around them.And the developer Cygames is extremely generous. RIdiculously so. Upon playing a tutorial (which you can skip), you're awarded with something akin to 50 free packs. If you were so minded, you could open all of them, dust the cards that you dislike, and immediately create a cheaper version of a meta deck to climb the ladder. If you start playing right now (in June), you'll reap the benefits of double rewards for completing daily missions, and a plethora of free packs (in the upcoming days), due to the anniversary of Shadowverse.This game isnt perfect. But it is VERY enjoyabole, and doesnt deserve the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 that its been getting.",

Power Creep Has Gotten Absolutely Out of ControlWe're at a point now where the ROTATION format, nevermind the Unlimited format with the far larger card pool, has cards such as 10 resources = Do 15 Damage (Anne's Sorcery) which is basically an auto win or a 5/3 Unit that can literally be played from the deck for free on TURN TWO (Flauros). These cards are not only stupidly imbalanced, but they inherently add RNG to the game because aggro decks can flat out get unbeatable nut draws and there is stone cold nothing the opponent can do, even if they play perfectly and have a reasonable draw. They've also recently introduced \"once you play this you gain an effect that happens every turn for the rest of the match no matter what\" cards which are also incredibly imbalanced and overpowered and have no counterplay. They're much like Planeswalkers in Magic: The Gathering- you're getting an effect that SHOULD cost resources for free every turn and it's way too strong. This problem is incredibly hard to fix too. Once they've introduced cards like this unless they were to go back and significantly change all of them there is no way around these kind of cards forever dominating the game. I see this problem getting worse over time as opposed to better and I think it's all downhill from here for the competitive metagame.2. Their New Card Pack Policy Is Seedy And Disrespectful To PlayersI've never seen any other card game (and I've played damn near all of them) do this, but Shadowverse's new thing is they'll introduce a \"full\" card set, make it available to players (and you MUST obtain the Legendaries and other strong cards from each new set when it comes out to stay competitively relevant) and then over a month later they'll introduce a small handful of new, broken cards (which of course includes multiple Legendaries) into the same set they've already released! This directly devalues all the packs you've already purchased of that set. This puts players in an absolute garbage position. You either buy packs of the new set right when it comes out, meaning you'll miss out on the broken cards in that set which will be released weeks later, or you wait until the second wave of cards from that set comes out but in the meantime you're not able to play competitively at the highest level because you do not have the new power cards from the set that just came out. Essentially, not only are they devaluing the packs you're purchasing but they're attempting to get you to buy packs of the same set twice. I find this really seedy and disrespectful to players and it feels like a shameless money-grabbing technique, which this game never used to have.Overall, I used to really, really love this game and I do, as of this writing, still play it but I can be objective and recognize major problems when I see them and this game definitely has them. We're not in \"sinking ship\" territory yet, and the game is still popular, but the quality and accessibility of the game have already gone down and will continue to go down and disaster IS looming over the horizon. I can't, in good conscience, recommend you start playing this game if you intend to play competitively whatsoever and I myself am likely to quit sometime sooner rather than later.",

                "text": "*IF YOU ARE ON THE FENCE ABOUT PLAYING SHADOWVERSE* The Take Two (arena-style draft) mode played against a friend is COMPLETELY free, and you can play it as much as you want. This is the best way to play with some of the neat legendary cards and to get a diverse feel for some of the classes with the least amount of investment. If you at least have a little cardgame knowledge (enough to draft with a friend and have fun), then this part is at least worth every bit of your time to download it and try it out. Anyways, Shadowverse is neat little collectible card game with a few unique mechanics, low RNG variance, and easy to learn cards that aren't written in Lawyer's Prose but have a layer of finesse to them, on top of a very, erm, deliberate choice of artstyle. You start with a rather generous amount of free card packs at the start, and is riddled with ways to earn packs/arena vouchers/gold/dust through the achievements system. Each of the classes feels very distinct from one another, and have rather strong identities, along with at least 1 mechanic many class cards are tied to. As an example, bloodcraft's minions are often tied to Vengence, which activates when a player hovers at 10 health or lower, making health management very important to that class. One of the most interesting aspects to Shadowverse is its Evolve mechanic which serves to make the midgame rather vibrant and adds a lot of extra decisions to consider, even when you may have few cards in your hand.If you're at all interested in playing, I'd recommend giving it a shot and, at the very least, \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 around in the Take Two mode.The PC port is better than the phone/emulator, but is little lacking in some ways; the interface is largely the same as the phone one, but the art on the cards looks much crisper and clearer. It's a lot better than on an emulator, but could be improved upon. Make sure if you're playing for the first time to fix your resolution and you toggle the option for 60fps instead of 30fps.",

As context, I have been playing this game ever since the Vanilla days, or right before the first ever expansion was released (Darkness Evolved or DE). I still play it occasionally and love it. However, although I enjoy Shadowverse, I can't recommend it to anyone anymore. Here are some of the problems with the game : good free to play experience when you forget that it takes 100 hrs or more to get the right cards for a single class to make a deck that won't be relevant for more than 3 months; Many questionable decisions from the developers when it comes to making new cards or balancing a meta-game; No matter how you want to play the game, there will always be a deck that will make you feel miserable in very rotation. These are just the few issues I have with what I see. I you never played this before, there is no reason for you to start now. There are better games and card games to chose from.",

                "text": "TL;DR at the bottom if you want to skip things like discussion about statistic. Review updated to fix few typos and incorrect terms. Things to note: The 2000 hours recorded in steam is me as a semi active player. I have been playing since Wonderland Dreams (which around december 2017) and I've been playing on my phone as well.For short term, yes, i would highly suggest this game. It's free, beautiful, story is as fun as sunday morning anime (good or bad depends on you like sunday morning anime), with enough work you can master few classes.But! That said..As a long term player the game is.. let's say.. \"Fluctuative\".. and \"Repetitive\"Let's dissect it one by one:1. The game has lots of cards, but at the end of the day there are only few card combinations a.k.a decks that could even step on the meta. Basically it is an illusion of choice, yes you can create thousands of combination from those cards but at the end of the day, you can only make around at least 8 decks that could survive the meta (at least 1 deck for each class, and just variations of that decks), other few meme decks, and endless unplayable combination that can cause your demise early before you can have that non meta combo you've been dreaming about.2. Because at the end of the day, there are only few workable decks in the meta. You'll be playing against the same several decks over and over, just with different player or luck (Ranked or Unranked, Rotation or Unlimited is often the same issue). Thus the \"Repetitive\" issue3. And because the game is \"repetitive\". Slowly you get bored playing against the same 8 decks over and over and over, then suddenly \"Oh woooowww!! new cards!!! it will definitely change the meta!! aahhh!! imma plaaay!!\" but then.. few weeks passed, against the same 8 decks over and over again, you became bored again.. then suddenly \"oh woooo!!! mini expansioon!! this previous useless cards became so good noooww  ahh!! imma plaaay!!\" but then same problem happens again, over and over. Until there is another expansion, ad infinitum. Hence the \"Fluctuative\" issue.4. Is both conclusion and 4th issue I has. I think the root of the problems is because the way of the dev's way of using their own statistic. First, they care more about deck's win rate rather than usage rate. Thus we might have a case like in 1st April 2020 patch where there is a nerf to a deck's card despite the deck's usage rate is 4th on the list (5% usage rate while the other nerfed deck got 30% usage rate. But they both got win rate beyond 55%, thus what basing the nerf). Second, they mostly care more about \"Addition\" rather than \"Upgrading\" a deck or class, that's why there are lots of dead decks that are irrelevant and each patch it keeps piling on. \"Oh these previously dead decks has low usage rate for now? wait for next expansion kay? and buy more packs mkay?\" and after said patch, yes the previously dead decks that has low usage suddenly spiked up, but it spiked up so much to the point of it became the new meta, thus stomping out the previous meta deck instead of the previous and current meta deck can compete with each other. Third, they didnt compare deck usage data (heck even deck's win rate i guess) against its own class. They often compare usage rate only against other classes, thus the problem of many deck becomes dead or created \"Repetitive\" issue earlier. For example, compare usage rate or win rate of artifact portal vs puppet portal vs float portal etc. or spellboost vs earthrite etc. and you can see quite clearly what deck that has overwhelming win rate or usage rate pretty quickly.The fourth, the last, and maybe a suggestion against the issues is, the addition of player satisfaction data. A simple thing like \"Did you enjoyed the match? Yes/No\" so you can start seeing decks that has \"Balanced\" win rate but judged as \"not fun\" or \"unfair\" or a \"Broken\" or \"Dead/meme\" decks but judged as \"fun\" or \"fair\". For example: Roach deck, it is (maybe) statistically \"balanced\" but many people complained against it, so by addition of player satisfaction data you can see this issue as a workable data.Thus you can \"nerf\" or \"update\" cards to not just to balance the meta, but to also increasing the user's overall satisfaction.And a bit of tangent on my side and a footnote(?) perhaps? I think because of these issues, that is why the game has issue of low player retention. Many player's interest piqued by the game, but they didnt manage to caught their interest long enough to make them play the game in long term. Which is a bad thing for free-to-play game because they need high player retention so many free players became long term paying player. And the data here supports it as well.The game players kept going down until there is a card release patch or mini expansion to boost it again, then going back down again, ad infinitum. Just like my criticism about its \"fluctuative\"ness. But maybe the reason for this phenomenon might differ if you ask other long term playersTL;DR: The game is fun for a short time, I will not suggest a continuous play else you might get bored quickly. Try not to reach Master rank too fast, else you'll get disillusioned by the meta pretty \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 quick. Play slow, play your meme deck, rank up slowly, and you'll enjoy this game much longer and might recommend it to your friends. Not like this ReviewerThank you for reading",

                "text": "\"Like Hearthstone, but better\" is pretty much the simplest way to explain this to most people. The game takes a lot of the core design elements from HS to make for smooth online play. Each player has their turn, there are no interrupts, etc. Where HS leans heavily on RNG and has questionable balance between classes, though, SV goes very light on the RNG has has multiple viable decks for all classes at all levels of play. SV also trades in a lot of HS staples like Weapons, Hero Powers and Secrets for new tricks like Countdown Amulets, Necromancy, Spellboost and the biggest mechanic of all: Evolve. Evolve is a game-changing, tempo-gaining mechanic that seems simple at first but has quite a bit of depth. You start the game with a few Evo Points and starting on turn 4 or 5 you can Evolve any follower you control which typically gives it a buff (usually +2/+2) and Rush (like Charge in HS but it can only attack other followers) but special followers will have other effects when evolved. Evo Points are POWERFUL and really set SV apart from HS and it's other clones. As for the business model, it's F2P and very fair. At least on par with HS, if not better. Newbies get a lot of freebies and there are login rewards, daily missions and monthly score rewards that all feed you a steady stream of cards. There is also a crafting system much like HS's whereby you liquefy cards you don't need and use your vials to create new ones. I'm quick to knock bad F2P practices but I have nothing to complain about here. Did I mention free friendly Arena matches? There are also free friendly Arena matches.Verdict: Try It! It's free!",

I love how the classes are completely unique from one another and love the tactics involved with classes like Havencraft and Bloodcraft.I used to be CRAZY into CCG's and TCG's (Played Yu-Gi-Oh as my first ever, and finally moved onto Magic soon after). My passion for TCG's and CCG's eventually died out after I'd grinded my heart and soul out on Hearthstone. Getting to high rank felt meaningless and Arena was a struggle as my Gold wasn't able to handle much more than a few a week. It has become more of a frustration rather than fun for me. Ladder was full of mindless decks which plays themselves and every opponent felt like they were bots, not human beings. F2P model of the HS makes the game infinitely grindy which forces you to pay to compete even at the lowest ranks. I was enjoying arena until it has become repetitive because of the dominant two or three classes so I quit.The game is extremely generous to you when you first start out, which really helps. Sure they give less gold compared to HS. But you only get one pr day. That is a bit of a vital difference. The score scheme plus the greater number of achievements are awesome. Which you are actually told about unlike Hearthstone where you basically have to go looking to sites to figure out what they want you to do. Plus daily log in bonus rewards. And finally. Arena tends to be more rewarding as well. So yes. I do see this game as a lot more generous than HS. Again. In just one week. I've gotten more than I've ever gotten in HS.You can also tell who came directly from Hearthstone and play exactly like Hearthstone as they play Swordcraft and just go face with everything no matter what like they are playing Zoo or Hunter lol. I just laugh and accept my free win as once turn 4 hits and my board fills with 3-4 big minions some with rush and then use evolve and destroy/banish spells to clear out all the junk and say hello to another win.So do I recommend it? Hell yes I do.",

                "text": "is a strategic card game that has been praised over the years, it presents itself with strong detailed art and a lot of different archetypes that players can choose to find out the one that suits their own playstyle the most. With extra modes such as take-two and balanced experience with solid online experience, it is sure to stand out from its competition in some elements.Something that is not too mentioned about  is the extra modes that can be played. The first one is  in which players must build a deck out of two different options of pair cards. This makes for a very interesting arena-like mode with lots of rewards to earn by winning in it, and a good way to explore factions or develop deck building skills. It is a lot of fun to play a section of it and it feels like a mini-tourney. There are also complete tournaments with branches and  in which players make a deck out of booster packs and get to keep the cards they obtain save for rare ones.The cards in the game can be quite expensive to craft in terms of how to acquire them. Ranging from prices of 800 up to 3000 its can be downright ruthless to craft a single copy of some cards, let alone three of them make a more structured deck. Obtaining three competitive decks took around 50 hours+a bit of money buying some packs.The mechanic that made me interested in  was the  Evolution works as a sort of comeback mechanic in which players can increase exponentially the power of their cards by spending  points during a match. It adds some thinking into its linear gameplay and is a blast witness as the arts of the card change individually per evolution, which means each card has its own evolution unique art. That is some dedication put into the game. As with free to play games, there is a catch. Otherwise it would not be free to play. In  this presents itself in the form of choosing between time or money. The game is more enjoyable when you have good cards so obtaining them becomes a priority and while you do get some free packs when starting, it is not even remotely enough to build a good deck. The player needs to choose whenever they want to invest a lot of time to get rewards or pay upfront for pre-decks or packs. It is a very good game but it demands commitment from the player one way or another.Monthly balanced patches keep the game in harmony with the meta, while there are some hiccups in some of the fixes to some cards, it does a solid job. Featuring to types of formats,  and  The first limits the cards that can be played to the last five sets while the latter allows players to build decks with any card of the game they might own.  is a perfect window for new players to be introduced to the game.There is a gacha presence in  and that is that some alternate  are locked behind huge pay-walls. They don't change anything gameplay-wise but have their own animations and tend to look better in some areas. To pull one of them, you have to get their card from their specific booster pack with a change of around 0.5% to pull them out. This makes pretty much unattainable unless you buy 100 to 400 booster packs for each, making them a gacha money aspect to the game. The aesthetic of the game is very beautiful, featuring  that are animated and have multiple skins while the card artwork has been carefully detailed. The  card are in particular just eye candy to see on display in the field, which makes them prized possessions and amazing when you pull one. The story of the game also features good artwork that helps picture the image that the characters give. Featuring detailed backgrounds with fine line-work and facial expressions is a delicacy to the eyes.The biggest weakness presented with  compared to its peers is that the game is very linear. Factions play the same routine and stick to similar decks, to the point where it feels that there is not as much room for creativity in contrast to other card games. You pick a faction and use their mechanics no matter the deck, which makes gameplay, not as tactical at times, and players online seem to use the same decks almost all the time. The story certainly is one of the things that impressed me when playing the game. It starts out as simple and linear but quickly becomes a series of developed plots in which the player chooses a character and sticks with them. Each character deals with a particular theme and narrative and some examples of these can be: dealing with conflicts between what right or wrong in a gray world.  seeking strength by pursuing powerful opponents which are perhaps a reflection of his vampire nature, a thirst he cannot satiate or  who wants to accomplish his goal of vanishing certain individuals yet doesn't know the meaning of companionship and the power of emotions.It is very complex and the character you choose will shape how you perceive events in the story, you can play all characters to your heart content but I recommend just beating each chapter with one character at first. The more you play it, the more interested and invested you become in its fantastical narrative and the worlds that are explored through it.The game runs perfectly on a GTX 1060 with no issues, it is locked to 60FPS. When first launching it, it will require to download the data thought it's own client. The story allows to skip chapters should they become too difficult for the player but won't give out the rewards, being there as an option to come back to certain specific encounters.What makes it special is that each faction plays in their own different specific ways. Some examples can be how  specializes in card draw and making their cards cheaper to play while  plays around with the comeback mechanic of evolution more closely, unlocking powerful abilities once their health is low and aiming to eliminate their opponent in a single strike. They each define what type of deck you will play and what goals you will develop during the match to secure your victory. is a game that is worth your time if you are looking for a new card game to play, it features excellent art with an interesting story and while it's gameplay is less tactical and more linear compared to fellow peer's of the same genre, simplicity can have its own set of charms. I recommend this game to those that enjoy card games and to those that would like to explore one, as it is very newbie-friendly and easy to learn. You will need to commit to the game, but the rewards are worth that commitment.",

                "text": "The game was a very solid free to play friendly CCG that was easy to get into.  I no longer believe the game is easy to get into due to dramatic increase in deck cost and greed of the publisher pushing mini expansions that only hurt free to play players.  The recent changes since the switch to a rotation and unlimited format modes have made the game significantly worse every expansion due to bad card balance, lack of nerfs and most of all an inability to balance the difference in win rate for players going first and players going second.  These are common complaints for any CCG and it would be easy to just write the rest of this review off based on it.  However, a little history is in order before your write this review off.First off Cygames, the publisher, previously had been nerfing cards every single month to attempt to balance the game. This worked out reasonably well and there was always a feeling of progress towards a balanced game.  One they often achieved towards the end of an expansion but it was never perfect.  Since the format change nerfs are far less common and when they do come they are months after the cards were generally recognized as oppressive.  An example of this being the most recent card change nerfed cards that were considered oppressive a week or less after released. However, they were not nerfed for an entire expansion and months into the next.  That alone is a bad sign but in between every month they released statistics and comments showing the deck the cards enabled had an oppressive win rate and was the most populare deck.  Instead they have tried reverting nerfs and buffing cards to affect change which has not worked well, has been very inconsistentl applied and only seem to focus on the unlimited format balance.Secondly, before the format change every single faction had a playable deck with many factions having 2-5 viable tournament or ladder decks.  Since the change many factions have not had a single viable deck at all in the Rotation format since the change at all or only for a very brief window.  The \u2018meta\u2019 of any specific expansion has gone from 10-15 or so decks that were viable to 3-7.  The terms playable and viable are quite debatable but in this context, I mean you could reasonably expect a 50%+ win rate on ladder with average luck and match ups.  The problem is that even if decks could on average achieve a 50%-win rate they would often have drastically one-sided match ups against the Tier 0/S decks that were the most popular on ladder.  It is very common to have a deck have a 48-52% win rate against 90% of match ups but a sub 40%-win rate vs. the two or three most popular and oppressive decks.  If a deck is near 50% against every other deck except the 2/3 meta decks that are 40% of the ladder it\u2019s not viable because with average match up luck you will no longer have an average 50%-win rate.  When this is true for many decks it indicate that 2/3 factions are over tuned relative to the remaining factions and should be nerfed. but this is no longer happening regularly. Which leads us to the arguably worst problem with Shadowverse currently.  The difference in win rate between the player going first and the player going second has been heavily in favor of the player going first for almost a year.  The publisher recently mentioned that players going first had win rates of 53.2% across all deck archetypes for the rotation format with a 51.3% rate for unlimited.  They acknowledge this a problem but took no action to adjust any cards balance.  The key to focus on here though is that the ratio is imbalanced badly in aggregate at the 53.2%-win rate.  This fundamentally means that there are many matchups where the ratio is far, far more one sided.  We have never had official numbers, but many player self-reporting tracking sites have had many oppressive decks having win rates for at 60%+ for many match ups going first even if the average win rate was \u2018only\u2019 54%.  If this deck is 20-25% of the ladder and you get unlucky going second 7+/10 games, a 17.19% change, you are not having any fun playing the game.  You are losing often simply because you went second.Finally, card games are defined by the mix of skill and random chance and that is what makes them enjoyable.  Everyone can accept losing because their opponent had the perfect god hand, or they did not draw a single playable card for 5 turns due to mana cost.  That is part of the nature of card games.  The problem Shadowverse has is far too many games result in you losing regardless of any action on your part due to simply going second or heavily one-sided match ups and the natural bad luck in card games.  This is especially seen in the pro tournament scene for the game.  Before the change to formats it was common to see the same faces in the top 10 positions in tournaments for multiple regions.  Now it\u2019s just random faces every week with 1-2 previous names if they got lucky.  Which is the problem with Shadowverse.  Winning or losing is far more about just luck these days than skill.  It\u2019s gone from being a competitive game to a CCG version of Mario party.  Fun to play or horrifically aggravating with nothing in between.",

Rather than nerfing the obviously overtuned cards to promote diversity straight away, (or just not releasing them like that to begin with) Cygames waits months before dropping a change, deceptively manipulates when and how they reveal statistics on the meta, and plays favorites with certain deck types. The result is games being decided by whether you go first or second and can consistently win by turn 6. It's exhausting. Save yourself the trouble and find something else.",

While Cygames has always adhered to the phiolosophy of quick games and powerful enders, there is only so much one can take of auto-losing to often unpreventable cards. While they have definitely improved with the latest expansions (by providing some more counterplay options, or making previous ones more playable), they haven't really stopped printing dumb cards that put a hard limit on the length of the game.  If you are looking to play the \"control\" style, then look elsewhere. In addition, the vocal parts of the community scream bloody murder should anyone suggest that games should be able to last more than 10 turns. Apparently the game is not designed to accomodate anyone with an attention span beyond 5 minutes.  The best part of the game remains that you are greatly rewarded for playing it regularly. If you keep up with your dailies and events, you will likely not need to spend any money, and be able to play the meta decks for most factions, although not immediately.  Being able to play you account both on Steam and on your phone/tablet (both iOS and Android) is also great, but that is hardly an innovative feature these days.",

I like CCGs and played quite a few of them, so it was very pleasant to get into an anime one for a change. Lots of waifu material, trying out classes and decks and so on. I'd want to say that somewhere on the way the devs took a wrong turn balance-wise, but truth is - there was never a good meta, 2-3 cancer decks always stomped anything else, classes' mechanics were underused to the point of many decks staying the same for years, also - the majority of decks are just played on-curve, without any decision making and thought process involved. And when sometimes devs took initiative, it always resulted in new disgusting forms of FotM cancer, which plagued ranked for a while, until players' activity drops and cancer finally gets nerfs. Now this isn't anything new for CCG or any other form of multiplayer competitive game, but the devs also acquired a taste for money and became insanely greedy, which is obvious when you look at it from a long run perspective. They've upped competitive decks' costs tenfold in terms of in-game card crafting currency; they've upped an amount of deliberately printed crappy legendary cards to dilute card pool; they've introduced a \"mini-extortion\" system - an innovative scheme of emptying players' coffers two times for the same expansion pack by adding even more high-price cards in the middle of an expansion, directly in the pool of a said expansion, so you'll never get them unless you're willing to spend much more currency; and finally - they went full on with the scheme of \"pushing\" some classes every expansion, so you'll spend all of your currency at a current FotM, which will become obsolete in a couple of months. And as an additional consequence of this - if you like a particular class and main it over others, prepare to be urinated on at the every expansion, when it becomes unplayable.The one thing that they've introduced to balance this bullshittery out a little are new unstable currency grinding techniques, which eat a lot of time every day and may (or may not) give you resources to keep up with insane rise in prices. That isn't even my personal salt - as a veteran player, I happen to have a significant amount of savings and a way of not becoming poor, but how new f2p players are supposed to cope - I don't even want to know.In the end, considering all of this, we have an overpriced CCG with nice artwork, primitive mechanics and dull meta with poor deck choice, which eats a lot of your time every day and offers little in terms of fun. And I almost forgot to mention - it serves as an advertisement platform for other projects of this company.",

I played this a lot when it was new, but with the introduction of these other expansions the game has just become exasperating.

It didn't sky rocket my wins, but I felt progress and that was rewarding. Now, I'm just \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.

This isn't to say that the game was so much better before or that there haven't been improvements.  It's gotten a lot better, but at a cost: I feel helpless. When I lose, I'm left thinking \"if only I had that new card from X expansion\", not \"I could have played that better\".Verdict: Play if you're willing to dump money everytime a new expansion comes out or go F2p and save everything for a single working deck that will last awhile.",

                "text": "I'll preface this by saying that normally I don't go out of my way to write reviews about games but the latest set of decisions by Cygames has been bad enough that I'm inclined to write one. To start with, Cygames decisions about the art, the straw that broke the camel's back for me. I started playing this game because when I tried it out I saw the evo art for some of the cards during the tutorial and actually enjoyed the fanservice. So I went and looked over what the other art in the game was like but noticed something strange in later sets, in that the fanservice was substantially less then in earlier sets. It was at that point that I found out that while art was still being taken from Rage of Bahamut, one of Cygames's other games, it was now being censored. And in more then a few cases the censorship was rather ugly like with the card Runie Resolute Diviner (examples here:  ) Aside from fanservice, crosses would also get removed sometimes in spite of being in artworks of priests who one would assume would carry such things. At no point in game was there any indication that this was being done, why it was being done or was any choice given to use the uncensored and better looking art. However up until the the update on the 27th of October, Cygames had never gone over old artworks and censored them. Now it has done so and gutted some 150+ artworks in the process. The art I joined this game for is dead and with it any remaining reason I have to stick around.The gameplay meanwhile has been on a downhill slope of extreme powercreep where a new Rotation expansion wipes out the bulk of the decks from the previous expansion before it too gets powercreeped into oblivion. As a result the cost of decks has gone up in both formats, be it the formerly cheap format that was Unlimited and in Rotation. Once expensive decks used to be the sole remit of ramp dragon with even that class having a cheap alternative deck but now even a \"cheap\" deck requires 2 sets of lengendaries, the most expensive rarity of cards in the game and the average deck will run many more. The closest to an attempt to reverse the trend in price increases was temp cards allowing you to make a copy of a single legendary and it comes nowhere close to succeeding. It's also substantially changed the character of the game, with gameplay from even as far back as Chronogenesis not even having a passing resemblance to how the game plays this expansion in my opinion for the worse. Old archetypes like Ramp Dragon or Midrange shadow in unlimited are dead and practically impossible to revive due to the extent of just how badly the game has been powercreeped. Transparency about balance is practically non existent, the only time the devs actually share statistics on which decks are doing well is when nerfs come out (and even then you'll only get the statistics of the decks being nerfed) otherwise you get a canned statement about no decks doing outsizedly well or having a high play percentage. This leaves the only way to attempt to gauge the meta being to keep up with tournaments as these are the only place where one can get some idea of what's good and the picture these paint is far from encouraging. This would not be so bad were it not for the fact that unlimited has for a good deal of time been functionally abandoned when it comes to balance in spite of there blatantly being decks that saw an oversized play and winrate throughout it's existence such as midrange shadow and artifact portal and warped the format around them.In game events meanwhile are lackluster and in some cases more of a source of frustration then anything else. Grand Prix, the most common in game event consists of of playing 5 matches with the same deck often in the exact same format against the exact same decks as you would in a regular game, rendering the event effectively glorified ranked just with some extra rewards. What few other grand prix formats exist are crippled by bad balance resulting in certain classes being blatantly stronger then their competitors and rendering them unplayable as a result due to the in game cost to actually play the format making it a net loss to attempt to play them while worse yet being heavily dependent upon RNG, such as in the case of the Gems of Fortune game mode wherein the cards one has to work with from game to game are entirely different but the mechanics by which one gets said cards blatantly favors certain classes.Bluntly I would not recommend this game unless you are willing to tolerate being given deliberately worse versions of art that Cygames can and will decide to make even worse later down the line while also having gameplay that is both extremely repetitive and progressively getting both more expensive and less enjoyable.",

                "text": "I'm going to compare Shadowverse directly to Hearthstone since that's probably where most of the interested players are coming from. Warning: This is pretty longThings SV does better:1. MUCH more variety than Shamanstone. We all know that Hearthstone is at an extremely low point right now- that's why competitors like TESL, GWENT, and SV are doing so well. All the classes in SV play differently and they all require different tactics to beat. Yeah, there's still the generic Zerg and Ramp class, but SV focuses a lot more on control and combo decks; Going aggro against Urias will get you slaughtered as he's able to push out stronger minions at lower health. But at the same time, going full on control against Isabelle may not go so well since she gets stronger the more spells she casts. You'll have to find a nice medium to do well.Something I really like is how you'll sometimes have to do something for the first part of the game, and then adopt a completely different strategy late game since that's when certain decks are at their strongest. I'm a particular fan of Luna's playstyle where certain cards grant her a secondary resource (shadow) that'll be immediately spent if you play certain other cards. The fact that it's immediate is nice since it makes you plan multiple turns ahead: yeah, you could drop a minion on an empty board this turn, but you'll automatically burn through the shadows needed to perform combos later on. In which case, the best decision is to pass the turn- something that is VERY rarely optimal in Hearthstone2. You don't have to play on curve every turn. Since your cards can have different effects based on which turn you play them on (like in my last example with Luna for example) as well as the order you play them on your turn, always playing on curve is not a smart decision. Curvestone players have the lesson of always needing to play on curve beaten into us; if you're stuck between two options in Curvestone, the best choice is almost always to just match the number of mana you have to the numer on the top left corner of the card. This Curvestone playstyle removes a lot of the thinking behind the game, which turns into a match of who can play more minions. A thinking card game like SV is a refreshing breath of air. 3.  waifus4. The animation is gorgeous. Some cards in SV are animated, which is basically the Hearthstone equilivant of golden cards. Most of the golden animations in Hearthstone are pretty meh, with the exception being the dragons and a couple of legendaries. But every animated card I've seen in SV has been absolutely beautiful: the colors all pop out and the transition from background to foreground is done seemlessly. 5. The story isn't exactly deep, but I was surprised by how much I found myself caring for the characters. Everyone has their own personality, hopes, and fears and if you dig past the bright colors and chirpy emotes and sound effects, it's actually pretty dark. A little girl having delusions of her dead parents and copes with their deaths by trying to kill everyone she meets? A man accidentally kills his friend and puts himself through self exile to protect his loved ones? A women tries in vain to resurrect her dead fiance after he's murdered by their mutual friend? The addition of a minion henchmen who reveal people's darkest fears and another who tempts the characters by promising them their heart's desires adds a surprising amount of depth to the characters of a free anime-esque card game 6.  Evolution lets you regain tempo really rapidly if you're starting to fall behind. You can smack a single opponent minion for massive amounts of damage in one turn, which in turn forces you to plan your moves ahead of time7. The BM is actually hilliarious in SV. If you play AI, they'll sometimes sarcastically emote how they'll ever deal with your minions, before dropping a board wipe. Or they'll emote a BM right before smacking your face for lethal. It's actually pretty funny and the way that automute works in SV is also better than HS. In Saltstone, you're muted for a certain amount of time depending on how often you're emoting. Whereas in Shadowverse, you're only limited to the number of emotes per turn. 8. Smaller board size. You can only have a total of 5 cards on the board and this includes minions, artifacts (like from TESL and MTG. Hearthstone doesn't have it), and effects that are only activated after a certain number of turns out in play (think something like a reverse overload: you pay X mana now and Y turns later, Z happens). This means you to spend more time deciding which cards to play to optimize your board.9. ARENA MODE IS FREEEE!! Kind of. Things HS does better than SV:1. Better menu UI. It's obvious where everything in HS is and how to access them. It took me 5 whole minutes just to learn how to open my cardpacks. 2. HS doesn't censor your decknames. Why is this a thing in SV?? How am I going to offend someone with my deckname that no one else can even see???Conclusion: If you're sick of Hearthstone, it's worth checking Shadowverse out. The story is surprisingly good, it's more control oriented, actually requires thinking, and most importantly, it's free! If you're not a fan of SV's artstyle (perfectly understandable), I suggest checking out TESL.",

                "text": "TL;DR: Shadowverse is an impressive game, and probably the best candidate so far to be in actual competition with Hearthstone. It has interesting mechanics and is reasonably polished. The story mode is cool, even though it's unfinished. I have no idea about the \"meta\" but that's something that will change over time anyway. Overall, recommend any fan of CCGs to give it a shot.Unlike all of the other Hearthstone-inspired games coming out, this game actually has an interesting setting. The characters are cool, and the cards are cool. This may not be important to everyone, but it's definitely important to some people, and it's important to me. I can't stand the thought of playing a game like Elder Scrolls Legends with its super generic western RPG setting with the same stuff we've seen thousands of times. This is the main reason I gave this game a shot in the first place.The game borrows heavily from Hearthstone, which is fine. Instead of Hero Powers to balance out RNG, we have Evolve, which is a much more powerful mechanic, although I find it a little boring. Amulets (basically like Enchantments from MTG) are a welcome addition, and the ones that count down by 1 each turn are cool. However, I find being limited to 5 minions on the board to be a little too restricting. I have a feeling this was a decision made in consideration of mobile, but it can't really be changed at this point without significantly changing the balance of the game. What I do like about it is that it allows for some more powerful effects, like \"Fanfare: Give +1/+1 to all followers.\" without potentially snowballing if you have a huge board.The artwork is quite good, and HiDPI compatible. The boards are cool, but they make the actual game very difficult to look at. There needs to be much more contrast between what is in play and the background. This is probably my #1 complaint about the game. The visual design of the Hearthstone interface is much more suited for the type of game this is.Please add an option to switch between Japanese and English voice acting. I'm sure the English cast is talented, but it just never sounds natural for people to read these scripts translated from Japanese. Speaking of which, I used the unofficial method to change to the Japanese audio, and I gotta say, the translation is pretty weird in some places. The text doesn't match what is being said at all, and the changes don't seem to make sense. It's not stuff people wouldn't understand or anything like that.This game is  a direct port of the mobile version. I think significant work should be put into making it better for PC users. I imagine they are just trying to see what the size of their audience on PC will be before committing too many resources. I hope that's true. Here are some of the issues I have:I think this game is quite entertaining and has potential. It has some unique mechanics and hero ideas that differentiate it from a sea of Hearthstone clones. I just hope they find enough of an audience to justify putting in the effort to make the PC version better. We'll see.",

                "text": "This is a very solid digital card game; if you\u2019re new to the CCG world and Hearthstone\u2019s Warcraft theme doesn\u2019t interest you too much, Shadowverse is a great alternative. It\u2019s addictive and fast-paced, it has nice art, and it\u2019s pretty easy to get a lot of free packs. If you\u2019re a Hearthstone veteran, this is definitely a Hearthstone clone to the core. The presentation, the card crafting system, the game mechanics (Battle Cry is now called Fanfare, Taunt is called Ward, etc.), the mission log, the card rarity tiers, and so on are all 99% the same. Heck, it even has an Arena mode. I think it\u2019s still worth playing even if you\u2019ve played Hearthstone, though; it has just enough unique stuff going on that it\u2019s different in interesting ways. I\u2019ll write a bit here about how Shadowverse is different from Hearthstone, so that you can differentiate between them and see what you think.- Shadowverse does have a few mechanics that you won't find in Hearthstone. One of the game's unique mechanics is the ability to \u201cEvolve\u201d your units. After a few opening turns, you'll get a small number of Evolve points that you can use on any of your units in the field \u2013 when a unit Evolves, it gets a stat boost, it sometimes gains an additional power or triggered ability, and it gets to attack on the same turn that it entered the field (a.k.a. Haste or Charge). This adds a nice extra level of strategy to the battle, because you have to consider whether or not your opponent is going to pop his or her Evolve and ruin your plans.  Every unit even has alternate Evolved art, which is a nice touch.- I was never super-attached to the Warcraft universe (though I loved Warcraft 2 back in the day), so I prefer the anime art and setting of Shadowverse over Heathstone. Shadowverse's art is really good \u2013 some of it is too \u201c~~kyaaaaaa~~\u201d for my taste but for the most part it looks great. The best art in the game is reserved for the character portraits of the major character classes (I especially like Erika, the Swordcraft hero) and the legendary cards. There are quite a few animations in the game as well. When you use the Evolve power, your character will leap out of his or her emblem and do an animated flourish that looks awesome. The English voice acting is a bit cheesy at times, but it's not that bad...honestly, the English voices are actually quite solid. If you can use Japanese voice mode, though, that's much better.- It\u2019s quite easy to get free packs. When you start the game for the first time, you\u2019ll get about 40 free packs from both the standard card pool and the latest expansion. I got a few nice legendaries, and I was quickly able to craft a couple more. While playing Hearthstone, I felt that the path to getting packs was a bit of a slog...Shadowverse is much more friendly about giving you packs and making legendaries that much more accessible.- One of the biggest and most welcome differences from Hearthstone is that Shadowverse has a story mode! The story stuff here isn't going to set the world on fire, but it's a really nice supplement to the multiplayer game. If you like card games with a single player mode or you just want to get in some AI practice with a bit more context to it, this is going to be right up your alley. Every class gets its own story, and playing through the story nets you a few story mode-exclusive cards. Some of these story mode cards are really great and can form the foundation of a good deck, so make sure that you take the time to play through every story.- Hearthstone is definitely more polished all around. It has that Blizzard sharpness to it that most other studios just can't fake, and Shadowverse is no different. Shadowverse started life as a a mobile game and it shows. The interface is a little clunky and awkward. This isn't a huge deal and Shadowverse is very playable...it's just not as user-friendly and easy to navigate as its high profile competition.- While Shadowverse might not have Hearthstone's polish, the online matchmaking here is actually *excellent*. It's really easy to find a game, and I never encountered any lag. It seems like the community for this game is pretty big and growing larger, which is great. My only complaint is that a surprising numbher of people would rather concede than play out a match and see what happens. It's like, come on...you've still got 10 health and 5 cards in your hand. See what happens!",

For example, just for logging in, you receive from 20 gold, to a arena ticket or even a basic pack.Right now after all my arena runs (I mostly do arena due to the fun I'm having, but if you are not familiar with card games, better just start a normal multiplayer game) I got like around 100 packs in totall (around 80 of them were given to me!)I think this game could potentially compete with Curvestone one day, if you are tired of rng based games, try it out!",

                "text": "Yes, it's a lot lilke Hearthstone, a game I enjoy immensely.BUT ... the quality of life touches in Shadowverse just make this game so much nicer to play.- Deck codes allow you to import an entire deck list instead of building it card by card.- Replay mode lets you review your last 10 games.- Story mode is more challenging and interesting than the Hearthstone tutorial.- Daily rewards just for logging in.- THREE quests every day.- Rewards for reaching milestones in Ranked play.- Special events with even more achievements and unique rewards.- Prebuilt decks available for purchase, allowing you a 100 percent chance of getting certain cards.HOWEVER ... I've now played enough of the game to see that the balance is very heavily skewed toward high-end-combo play. Most games between competitive decks are just a race to see who can get the big legendary combo off first, or to see if you can play your combo before the other guy draws the counter. All other turns are rendered trivial, so in a lot of cases it just boils down to a coin toss.I'm not going to take back my positive review because I really do admire the foundation. And I recognize that other people do like this style of gameplay; it's just not for me. So while I'm going to uninstall it after saving this revised review, I still think it's worth a try for those who like CCGs. It's free, after all, and they are pretty generous with the cards, even though you'll never get enough free cards to be competitive.",

This all because Cygames won't nerf broken rare or legendary cards.   Once in a while they nerf problematic cards, but it's only once every three months.  This means ladder is filled with the latest cancer inducing play for 3 months and only 1 month of \"fair\" and \"balanced\" play before the next expansion comes out with even more powercreep than the last.Post Rebirth of Glory review:Cygames really outdid themselves with this expansion.  Not only did they completely overload Bloodcraft and Havencraft to ridiculous levels of power, but their first rounds of nerfs did absolutely nothing to change the state of the game.  Even after Tempest of the Gods, Wonderland Dreams, and Omen of One,  they never learned their lesson: STOP IT WITH PET CLASSES.  We get it, KMR loves Bloodcraft.  Oh and you think Unlimited is safe?  KMR to the rescue with new Rhinoceroach that kills you from hand on turn 6 without any counterplay other than kill them first (harder said than done).  For almost two years now and every expansion except Dawnight Breakedge (powerlevel was kept low in that expansion) it's been the same.  This is easily the worst class balance tradeable card games in existance, and will probably stay that way because KMR is still practicing his Vampire (Bloodcraft) until the game is dead.The reasoning for poor class balance is because of one thing: moneitzation for leaders.  Once in a while there's a promotion from another game/anime/media, and in order for people to spend money to buy these leaders they have to make that class strong.  Recently they made a Re;Zero colaboration and the most popular characters in that anime, Rem and Emilia, just happen to be Bloodcraft (broken rotation class) and Forestcraft (broken unlimited class).  Only when these promotions end is when Cygames gets off their butts and balance the game, but half of the time they nerf completely unrelated cards from other classes.  Runecraft most picked class by miles?  Let's gut a Swordcraft card instead.  It's mind boggling how they decide to nerf classes or cards except in attempt to get you to buy leaders for broken classes instead.  \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 this game. Play Hearthstone.",

Get packs\"I hate dying to an unstoppable OTK!\"Well yes son, that's called a win condition, and you should have one too, like I dunno, Dimension Shift Flame and Glass OTK. So now that's I've addressed those, some things you should know about this game. The design philosophy is that every class has an inherent \"I win\" button that takes many forms. A match is intended to end 2 turns before or exactly on turn 10. That being said, you have to really know what you want to do, and no you do not need to spend a single dime. Pick an idea, and use it to make all the decks you want. Here are some budget big slammy decks for new players:Forest: - Aggro Buff Forest. Literally no legendaries required, grand majority bronze, cheaper than dirt.- Rhinoceroach. Just need to make 3 gold bois, and keep bouncing those gold bois to hand. Even uses some basic cards.Shadowcraft:- Deathly Tyrant OTK. Fill your deck with cards that make more followers with a gloaming tombs, then slam your opponent for 3/4 of their total HP.Swordcraft:- Aggro. Insert Storm. Win. It ends on turn 5.- Ambush Buff/Rogue's Creed. Buff ambushed (stealthed) minions into lethal range. Win.Havencraft:- Holy Mage OTK. Craft 3 Golden Cities. Play Holy Mage, and spam amulets until Holy Mage obliterates your opponent.Dragoncraft:- Ramp Dragon. Just out value your opponent and bean them.- Storm Dragon. Hippogryph Rider.Not many options for Dragon tbh, there's a reason they're called \"Wallet Dragon\"Bloodcraft:- Vengeance Storm. Have 10 or lower life. Now a lot of your followers just SLAM your opponent in the face for big ouchies.- Bloodfang Aggro. With Old King, this deck can be a thing.Portal: - Synthia OTK. Just craft 3 Synthias, put Radiant Artifacts in your deck, and slam your opponent in the face depending on the amount of artifacts you managed to lose this game.Runecraft:- The afforementioned Dimension Shift deck.- Dirt Rune. It's dirt cheap, and you just burn your opponent until they stop moving.- Mysteria OTK. Mysteria OTK doesn't actually run any legendaries. You can make it work if you make yourself 3 Annes.",

                "text": "- Cons and Pros last paragraph Super important note: If you think you like the game and can see yourself playing it for the long run, I recommend rerolling to optimize your experience as a beginner. First, download the mobile version and keep rerolling. With each reroll, open your new account's packs and share it on the games' official discord for opinions on your legendary cards and if they are worth keeping, or should just reroll for another chance. Note that rerolling is not possible on steam unlesss you're planning on creating a steam account for each reroll.Pretty awesome game. it looks bland and generic at first, but it gets better the more you understand it and the more you dive deep into it's mechanics and gameplay. You find yourself getting attached to some cards, for example. there's a story that is funnily boring at first. but it gets intense in many parts and keeps you engaged with it's characters, plot and twists. VN players will enjoy this free experience I'm sure.The devs throw so many packs for new players 50+ just for creating an account, and more packs just for doing story and beginner quests. after finishing them all, ( would take two to three days maximum depending on your speed) you'll eventually open around 100+ packs. the game isn't p2w at all, and doesn't require a penny if you play it consistently, just like any other CCG tbh.PVP will teach you the game slowly and how many cards works and what not. You get Ranked rewards for winning. Meta decks will require some work to be able to craft them. You get a lot of Vials ( to craft cards ) that you can work with and grind for to be able to craft Meta cards. Or simply open a pack and pray for a certain card you're looking for. Meta state of the game gets boring sometimes, normally repetitive depending on the format you're playing in. Rotation: players can play with the last 5 expansions released, Or Unlimited: players play all the expansions available in the game.Pros:- many classes of leaders to choose from, each with their own playstyle and unique cards.- Tons of rewards that keeps coming for new/old players- with each new expansion, players get 10 packs for free, and 5 more packs 2 months after the release of a new expansion, Grandmasters get another 10 packs.- you're most likely able to create a Meta deck right from the beginning to be able to grind and start your journey with a strong deck. (Depends on your luck) Cons:- Like any CCG game, if you take a month or two or freaking three months break without playing, the game punishes you hard, because powercreep exist. most old cards (not all) will be dominated by new cards. leaving you with an old deck that's not worth much And can't win you games anymore. Also, daily quests\\logins are going to be your only source of pack openings, missing them isn't fun at all.- The Meta can get very repetitive at times, it's gotten a little better now, but still, repetitiveness is awkwardly there, not as boring as before that's for sure. and it's extremely repetitive when playing the Rotation format since people are forced to build decks from the last 5 expansions only.The game is worth checking out, but certainly not for everyone, and despite it's flaws it still is a fun game.",

                "text": "I've played Yugioh competetively, Magic the Gathering casually, and a little bit of Cardfight Vanguard just for fun, for many years now; so shadowverse claiming to be the #1 online CCG in japan caught my interest quite awhile ago. A Fate collaboration event finally got me to install and try it. At first glance, Shadowverse is a beautiful card game with great voice acting and fantastic card/character art for even the most basic cards. The option to craft cards is a great addition too (though with a pretty inflated price) so if rng keeps screwing you over with card packs you can eventually get the card you want. However, despite having a tutorial explain each faction's playstyle and a very generous free 50 card packs for completing said tutorial, Shadowverse is not newbie friendly. Any new player will get utterally wrecked in online play, and there seems to be no type of matchmaking or trueskill algorithm to make pairing more fair. This makes completing missions (which are mostly, win x times with this faction) difficult to complete making it harder to get more card packs without spending real money. I went ahead and spent quite a bit of money to get some prebuilt decks to help aleviate this thinking I would be playing this game for quite awhile, and it didn't help much; I really regret my purchases. I found out soon after why; there is very little balance to this game. Each faction has several cards that have insanely op effects that pretty much win you the game. Example would be an amulet that summons other amulets that declare you the winner in 3 turns unless you banish the amulet (theres very few amulet banishing cards and they usually cost a fair amount to cast, destroying the amulet just grants the effect anyway), or a unit that spellboosts YOUR ENTIRE DECK 9 TIMES, which means your opponent can cast high cost spellboost cards for 1 to 0 orbs or do high effect damage for little cost. If your opponent gets these cards on the field your pretty much done. There are no hand traps, no opponent turn player activatble effects, no graveyard effects, there is no way to stop these cards. Even some of the normal cards would be considered op in other games, such as one that transforms all your followers on the field into flaming rats, or just straight up destroys your entire field. Really? All of them? Did Bob Ross come back and give you that idea? Turn all your problems into flaming rats? It's not even all that expensive to cast either. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with these kinds of cards, there are other crazy op cards in other card games as well. But the fact that there is no way to stop these effects like in other card games is what breaks the game for me. It basically boils down to, survive long enough to draw your win condition card, and thats it. There is very little alternate strategy, and because of that I honestly can't recommend this game. Even if you find yourself liking the game anyway, dont spend any real money. It's not worth it. The only reason why I'm still playing this game is because I'd be wasting my money otherwise.",

You get showered with packs, and can quickly get to do 1 or 2 meta decks. Also there are many constant events like chest ones and GPs, and daily login bonuses that let you rack up those rupies.The gameplay itself has less RNG, and the evolution aspect feels fun and adds it's own charm to this game,However in terms of skill, you can see it has the game philosophy of a mobile game, matches are way faster, there is little HP, and there aren't many options to do in most situations, plus a lot of decks are just playing stuff on curve.As a result, it's a game hard to learn and easy to master, the skill gap between an A rank and a GM is not that big. Hearthstone has more of a skill ceiling in this regard, this does not hurt the experience at all unless you are concerned about it.Also the game does have originality on its design like leader effects and invocation mechanics. And every year it's bringing something unique to distance themselves more from other games and to stand apart.Overall I think Shadowverse is on a good spot on the options to play if you want to play a F2P CCG. Only in those terms though. The reason why i don't recommend it. It's because you can get banned for no reason. I had 2k hours in this game, and one day. I just got banned for no reason, despite using no mods, 3rd party apps, or altering the game at all. I had no way to appeal since contacting them is useless because you get automated responses.I just can't recommend a game where you can get banned for no reason and lose all you've got. This is the only game where that has happened to me.",

But let's break it down by categories to get a better judgement.Hearthstone and Shadowverse apply the same concepts, mana/energy points to dictate the game, dropping minions and utilizing spells to win the match. The difference however, in Hearthstone you have hero powers, and the latter has another layer to influence the nature of the board - card evolution. I really can't pick which one is better, as either mechanics seem suitable for respective games. I personally think it's unique to each game and we ought to respect that. At the end of the day, it's a matter of preference.Being CCG, there's basic way to collect cards. It's all the same on both games, disenchanting/liquefying will earn you materials (dust/vial) while crafting/creating will deplete your mats and earn your card. You can earn more by opening card packs.Blizzard win when it comes to character selections, however. It comes with nine heroes with its each unique traits, as opposed to Shadowverse's seven heroes.Conclusion: Hearthstone wins ever so slightly.Frankly, Blizzard's multi million dollars resources really shine here. The graphic, voice actors, the story telling, background music really show their worth. The graphic is crisp, rendered by Unity engine, arena is beautifully designed, each detail is drawn meticulously. Graphic options are limited, though only fullscreen/windowed and quality. But eh, I can run it 60 FPS flat, so yeah.Shadowverse is also voiced and have more animations, but many of them are cringe worthy for being too cliche (for me anyway). Well, you know, anime style, although I like anime like Steins;Gate, CLANNAD, Gundam, Naruto I still can't swallow it. Graphic also has less depth and the arena is bland, not even eye catching. It does run on 60 fps for my machine, but has less quality as a whole.Conclusion: Hearthstone wins.In this part, Blizzard win hands down no contest. Shadowverse has too many quirks, even navigating my card collection requires me to wait for 2-3 secs just to flip the page. In HS, this issue does not exist, loading is only when you open the menu, the rest is smoothly navigated once the initial loading is done. I reckon the infrastructure is simply superior, since HS has many servers and definitely better network support.Conclusion: Hearthstone wins.Both games include single player and multi player. In Hearthstone it's called Adventure and Tavern Inn to practice. Adventure can be purchased with gold, but you'll gouge your eyes out trying to purchase the wings with gold only. Sometimes Blizzard hand out part of the package for free, but you'll be hard pressed to appreciate it - since even in my eyes it's no more than marketing tactics to entice people to buy whole wings. As for Shadowverse, SP mode comes for free, with all heroes have their own background stories. And yes, it has AI mode. More details below.Conclusion: Shadowverse wins.As free players, disregarding environment and meta, you'll appreciate that Shadowverse hands out freebies more often than Blizzard. Just completing tutorials will earn you plentiful of packs, and from what I have seen, they also handed out more freebies be it through events or special occasions. Blizzard? Very stingy. They do give freebies, but very limited. Gotta do with basic decks, folks!Conclusion: Shadowverse wins hands down.Big question, is SV gonna die soon?Nah, I don't think so. It's not as massive as Hearthstone, but it's because (probably):1. Anime-ish. God forbids anything related to anime to be massively popular.2. The developer doesn't have Blizzard's resources to promote their game e.g making this e-sports or cross advertising on 5 million subscribers MMORPG aka World of Warcraft. This leads to 3.3. Lesser technical quality than Hearthstone....but I think it's going to stay for foreseeable future. Hearthstone, though, still wins by landslide. We all know how vigilant Blizzard are when maintaining their games. See Warcraft 3 and Diablo 2 which is still updated after decade.Conclusion: Hearthstone wins by miles ahead.How this game could be improved? Adding achievements and trading cards would be easy and nice addition, but  is critical while adding contents should be done on regular basis. Blizzard have proven their track records by adding multiple expansion packs, while this Cyagames still need to face the test of time. We'll see.And it's fun just by opening those card packs. Believe me, it has some digital drugs attached to opening card pack mechanic. :))",

                "text": "(originally from josealdos but it summarizes perfectly my view on the game and the state it is in)A big part of the issue with this game is that every deck in this game is turning into a variation of \"combo.\" It's essentially combo decks fighting other combo decks so you don't get the self-balancing \"rock paper scissors\" aspect you see in other games (aggro, control, combo, midrange, etc). In this game, the line between deck types/archetypes has effectively been blurred. Control (in a pure sense: controlling the board, running your opponent out of resources, stuff like that) doesn't exist in this game like it does in others because there just aren't good control tools in this game.Shadowverse has always been a quick game with powerful finishers. As time went on, this aspect of the game got worse and worse. Basically Sword was one of the few remaining \"pure/respectable\" classes that didn't really have a \"combo.\" That's now gone. Strong effects/evolves also have very little tempo loss.This makes me just not want to play the game anymore at all. Unlimited is awful and even worse than Rotation. The game is interactive in the sense that you are racing for your win condition. There is very little interactivity in the sense of you doing something against your opponent. It's more like solitaire. Your draws and accelerating your win condition are the only things that matter.This is why I'm waiting until the 5th anniversary. If they don't do anything major for a large anniversary like this, then I'm gone. The amount of things to do and gamemodes in this game is just laughable compared to like hearthstone & legends of runeterra.edit: This affects the singleplayer content to a lesser degree and the solo campaigns are pretty well done, so if you are a pure solo player the game might be recommended.Also the matchmaking in PvP is bottom of the barrel and seems to only randomly connect people instead of actually searching for a decent match (not skill-based).",

But, how it handle the data of the game is suck in my opinion.So, you download the game from steam, right? And usually, you install it inside your own game drive(for example, you install it in F drive instead of usual C drive) to avoid cluttering your windows drive. Then, you launch the game, and it start downloading the game data, which is fine. But, instead downloading the data into your F drive, it download the data into the AppData in your C drive, and you can't change it. And, all of that data DOESN'T DELETE ITSELF when you UNINSTALL the GAME. You actually need to delete it from your AppData MANUALLY. I've been wondering why my C drive suddenly go into red, and now I know why. I hope it got fixed in the future. Or if it really is how it works, then that sucks. I have my own game drive for a reason.If you in for a card game with waifu in it, then this game is ok and you should at least try the game a bit. But, if you have a toaster pc with low storage or using C Drive SSD dedicated to windows only, then don't even think to install the game.I'm sorry, English is not my first language.",

The fact that you'll only face meta decks (and they're all the same damn meta decks) is just a terrible play experience.-The art, music, story, and overall game idea of Shadowverse is great.Most of the time you'll be showered in rewards like in no other game. It is incredibly easy to pull out legendaries from your packs (even three at a time), and together with this you're presented with an awesome art style that had a lot of pontetial, but ultimately is wasted because of the cards that are just too powerful.Overall, Shadowverse is a game that should be played only casually, and with friends (like all card games, in my opinion). Because this way, it can be extremely fun and strategic. This combined with the art and the ludicrous things a casual deck can pull off, it makes for a good time to have a laugh (or pray in despair as your friend evolves).",

                "text": "Having played this game since way before it came out on steam (probably over 1k hours) i can agree with almost all of the negative reviews from players with 200+h on the game.The game went downhill after the first expansion, back in DE we could still play over 10 viable DIFFERENT meta decks and still reach masters and with each expansion after DE the meta came down to fewer and fewer decks.In RoB it was mainly Sword, in Totg it was mainly shadow and right now we have Blood with 56% playrate @ 62% winrate (which is the most broken deck ever)So i really can't recommend this game to anyone in it's current state. Telling people the game is good right now would be a total lie and i won't bother playing it much until a balance patch or next expansion. Shadowverse was my favourite CCG (and probably still is) but the current state is horrible and not fun to play at all. If they don't change their policy of not nerfing legendaries they will be losing a lot of players with this expansion after finally growing this much.That's my review as a very veteran player in this game, hope this helps. #saveshadowverse",

                "text": "I've been playing this game for a while. It used to be good, but the last couple of expansions have been slowly killing it. Top-tier decks have been getting more and more expensive, often requiring multiple legendaries, and by the time you scrounge together enough vials to make the deck you want, another expansion has already been released and you're back at square one. For the Dawnbreak expansion, Cygames has split the expansion into two pieces, which in my opinion is a pretty transparent money-grab so that people have to spend more per expansion to get the second batch of cards that get released, regardless of what people say to justify it. Assuming this is the new normal, that means that every two months, you will have to collect more new cards to keep afloat with the Rotation meta. Not even the extremely expensive MTG is quite that cruel to its playerbase.The game used to be pretty good about not being a scummy mobile gacha game, but they've completely abandoned that premise lately. Emblems, sleeves, and alternate leaders are locked behind ridiculous paywalls and exclusive events. Normally, I wouldn't care, but these kinds of business practices just leave a bad taste in my mouth. Instead of working on game balance and QOL changes, they seem to only worry about coming up with creative ways of separating people from their money. They could easily put all this stuff in a store and just let the whales finance their operation like every other \"F2P\" game, but there's something particularly sinister about preying on people's gambling habits.As for the games themselves, a lot of games are decided by your starting hand and whether you go first or second, more so now than ever before, and the devs seem uninterested in changing this. Playing aggro and going second? You lose. Playing a combo mirror and you go first? You win. Because of how almost every win-condition in this game is designed to be huge burst damage or an OTK, going first means you get to play your win condition before your opponent, which means you always want to go first.Take Two has become a slot machine of picking the best classes and hoping to get the auto-win cards that will breeze you to 5 wins. Gone are the days when you could draft an interesting deck with a class of your choice and have some fun games. The rewards for Take Two only give you a profit if you go 5-0, so playing Take Two indefinitely is practically impossible without sinking money into the game or farming quests.And Unlimited...Most of my cards are from the first couple of expansions, so I tend to play more Unlimited than Rotation, but the format has become pretty much unbearable. Cards like Roach, D-Shift, Daria, and Ceridwen are warping the format to unplayability. Even though almost the entire playerbase has been complaining about these cards for years, Cygames is intent on letting the power level of these cards remain unchanged to plague the format for however long we have to suffer through them. Cygames even had the bright idea of hosting an Unlimited tournament, which was just a torturous gauntlet of Daria decks. Seriously, on the last day of the tournament, I played against six Daria decks in a row.A lot of the things I used to enjoy about this game (the minimal RNG, the generous F2P nature, the variety of decks and playstyles) have basically disappeared at this point. I'm getting the impression that Cygames is losing control of their game, and doesn't quite know what to do to turn it around.I put a fair amount of money into the game when I first started, and felt like the initial investment was worth it. You didn't need to sink hundreds of dollars into the game to be competitive. But as of right now, the money you would put into this game has diminishing returns. I would either go completely F2P, or limit yourself to a very small amount per month (around $5-$10 per month). The expansions come out way too fast in Rotation for you to keep up, and Unlimited has become far too stagnant for your old collection to be worth building up (unless you really enjoy playing Daria or Roach Forest, for some ungodly reason).Another freemium game with potential bites the dust, I guess.",

                "text": "EDIT:Well, it's been quite a while since I posted this review, and to their credit, the developers have made some solid steps in the right direction.  Not the least of which that they finally (FINALLY) broke down and started nerfing problem legendaries, which many of us feared was against some internal, unwritten policy.The last expansion was pretty decent, aside from the wildly overtuned Prime Dragon Keeper, which has since been brought into line.  Without killing the card completely.   Which is another thing I do like: when they nerf, it's clear they at least INTEND to try and keep the card playable but fair, even if they don't always hit the mark.  Compare to Warsong Commander's 'soul of the card' nerf in Hearthstone.  Brutal.So yeah:Pros:-WAY more generous than its other main competition.  Dozens of free packs just for sighning up!-Cute Waifus.-Overall superior class identity and interesting mechanics.-Real attempt to support unplayable but interesting cards, and seen in the rise of Atomeme.-Willingness to admit mistakes and address them without overnerfing.Cons:-Heavy push for games to end fast, often resulting in lopsided, aggro vs aggro metas.-Every expansion seems to pretty much break the game at this point, and only a month later on their scheduled balance pass does it get better again.-Kinda sleazy practices with the slot-machine class skins . . . though they are only cosmetic, I guess.-Basically almost everything conceptually wrong with Hearthstone, though to a lesser degree.I still play the game from time to time, but you really gotta make that call for yourself.  For all its faults, it's still way better than Hearthstone.  And that's something.ORIGINAL REVIEW:One of the most shocking and saddening turnarounds I've ever seen in an online game.  How could it go so wrong, so fast?A couple of expansions ago, I left Hearthstone for good in favor of Shadowverse, and at that time my opinion of this game was extremely high.  Now, it's only marginally better than Hearthstone was at its worst, and that's saying something.Horrifically broken legendary win-conditions (in only a few classes, of course, to ensure nearly no diversity) have essentially power-creeped the evolution mechanic itself into irrelevancy, giving whoever goes first a massive advantage.  Games are far too close to coin flips at this point, where if the player going first has a good hand, they are nearly unbeatable.I will continue to look in on this game, as the developers have promised frequent balance passes (unlike a certain other popular card game), and if these issues are fixed, I'll be certain to change this review to a recommendation, since the base game WAS excellent in my opinion.  And could still be again.But as things stand now?  Stay away.  If you're really intrigued by the oodles of freebies and cute waifus, maybe make an account and gather daily login rewards on the chance that they fix this mess, but actually playing the game at this point is just too frustrating.But that's just, like, my opinion, man.",

Spending hundreds/thousands of dollars on a game, only to be rewarded with higher pack prices, and a forced meta they decide with every expansion? Or maybe you just aren\u2019t a fan of the RNG \u201cclown fiesta\u201d that most matches become. To be fair, I used to love the game. Blizzard took a lot of elements I liked about Magic: The Gathering and did away with some things I disliked, and made a really great game. I\u2019ve played off and on for months at a time since open beta, and have had some of the most fun I\u2019ve had in a game while playing it. With all of the money I\u2019ve invested in it, I\u2019ve been pretty bummed out by recent design decisions along with some of their commercial shifts. So much so that I uninstalled the app from my phone and haven\u2019t logged in on desktop for quite some time.Enter Shadowverse. Before I offer my opinions on the game, I should also say that I also played a lot of Rage of Bahamut on my phone (the order I was in was ranked #5 in the world competitively). To be quite honest, it wasn\u2019t that great of a game mechanically, but I was hooked \u2013 mainly on the social aspect and the artwork. I stopped playing a bit before they shut down their servers in North America, but I was pretty sad to see it go. So along comes this offering from Cygames. I was surprised to see they had repurposed (and preserved) a lot of the art from RoB. As a huge fan of it (I\u2019m still an anime nerd, after all), I was immediately intrigued. I soon discovered the game plays a lot like Hearthstone but also has some really interesting design choices. Things like being able to evolve followers (minions, creatures etc.) at certain points in the match, making them much stronger and in some cases activating certain abilities. It has a lot of mechanics that you\u2019d expect in a game like this (ambush = stealth, storm = charge, fanfare = battlecry, last words = deathrattle and so on). There are class-specific cards that can only be played with that leader (hero, basically) and a pool of neutral cards that can be used in any deck. The cards you get can be liquefied (dusted) for vials that you use to create the cards you want, with the rarity determining their respective worth. The meta on the ladder is pretty healthy at the moment, and there are a myriad of ways to build decks within their respective archetypes. The classes all have distinct mechanics akin to Hero Powers that differentiate them from one another, making their identities really stand out. They also have a pretty engaging solo story mode for each class you can play, allowing you to earn rewards while learning how the play the class. This makes it a unique digital CCG while remaining intuitively familiar.Where it really shines though is its F2P system. While not as generous as say, Eternal, you are handsomely rewarded for your playtime and efforts. You get a ton of free packs as a new player (10 from each expansion, if I'm not mistaken), and a lot of tickets for packs and gold to buy them with as you play the various solo and multiplayer game modes. I don\u2019t play a lot of Take Two, the Shadowverse equivalent of Hearthstone\u2019s Arena, but its reward system is also nice. You\u2019re provided 4 cards in a 2 pairs at a time, and you a pick a pair of them until the deck is complete. As with Hearthstone, these aren\u2019t yours to keep, however (unlike Eternal\u2019s drafting system). You then play a 5 match game \u2013 5 matches total, win or lose, and are rewarded at the very least a ticket for a free card pack. You can play this mode by entering with tickets or gold you earn throughout the game. If you\u2019re any good at it, it may be more profitable than outright buying packs themselves (I personally don\u2019t play it that much is I have a hard time evaluating the best choices to make.). With all of that said, they are a business after all, and developers need to get paid, so pretty much all of this can be bought with crystals, an in-game currency you can buy with cash. I\u2019ve spent a bit on it, but its reasonably priced, and considering the fun I\u2019ve had and the amount of time I\u2019ve been playing, I figure it\u2019s worth it.I didn\u2019t touch on the ladder ranking system (it\u2019s pretty grindy, but the rewards are worth it), the rest of the MTX available for purchase, or some of the other features in the game because those are worth checking out on your own. If you\u2019re over Hearthstone \u2013 or even if you completely love it (or perhaps you have never played it all, but enjoy CCGs like MTG, Hex, Eternal etc.) this game is definitely one you should consider trying out.",

Just when you think the meta is settling and the cards are balanced, some form of gamebreaking nonsense that no one enjoys gets (re)introduced. Do you like getting hit in the face for limitless frequently unblockable damage? Do you like losing turn 1 because the enemy had a 1 drop and you didn't? Do you like losing mirror matches every time you go second? Do you like not being able to predict your enemy because their cards have a high chance of costing 0 depending on highroll? Shadowverse may be for you! Seriously it may sound like salt but every single game is a coin flip (that's as long as you're using one of the 1-2 meta approved broken decks...otherwise you'll never win). When people say there's strategy and planning involved in shadowverse it makes me laugh...those players just don't understand they have consistently good luck. The most strategic thing about Shadowverse is the mulligan phase...and even that is obviously left up to chance. As long as you draw your OP legendary before they draw their OP legendary, congratulations, you've won! While yes this is a card game and is inherently luck based, please take my word in that Shadowverse leaves the player with a particular feeling of helplessness and the decks all basically autopilot themselves at this point in time.Strategy and planning in this game died long ago...you will get steam rolled every time you decide not to partake in the particular archetype that Cygames has decided to ram down the community's throat. Right now that's ramp dragon with a hint of mysterian \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 sprinkled on top...but don't worry...maybe the class you like will get it's abhorrently broken time in the spotlight. If you're anything like me though, you won't even want to touch it anymore upon seeing what an OP cluster\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 they made it into.",

When RNG is present, it's tastefully done and a small chunk of RNG is good for card games.Easily one of the best card games and I'm glad it's finally on Steam! Linking my account to my Steam account was super easy.My only suggestion to the developers is possibly making a more fulfilling arena experience by allowing us to get higher than 5 wins. I feel as though that's one thing Hearthstone did really well.",

Decks such as PTP forestcraft needed lots of skill to play and have plenty of decision making involved which frankly is the best part of any CCG.

There are some interesting mechanics that can really add to the experience like evolving monsters which boosts their stats and sometimes activates secondary effects. In my experience, there is much better game balancing than most of the competing online CCGs, Hearthstone included. The game also has a single player story mode where you play through the perspective of different characters whilst simultaenously allowing you to earn more cards to use in the multiplayer modes. It won't win any awards for the writing but it does keep you engaged and is suprisingly deep for what was originally a free to play mobile game. \u00a8Bottom line, if you're looking for a deep CCG or just a fun way to kill time, you have nothing to lose by checking this game out.",

And this is perfectly cemented by the Chronogenesis expansion pack and the March Grand Prix open tournament. What is the most important asset in a CCG? A well made deck? The knowledge to know how to handle your opponent's deck while putting out your own?To the developers its neither of these. To them the perfect deck is purely based on luck. It's hard to describe to new and potential players why this is such a problem so I'll put it this way. For 3 months the community has talked about one specific deck. A deck based solely on your opening hand and drawing specific cards. For months the community has asked for adjustments so that this one deck does not run rampant. For months the developers have ignored the community.Every month there is an adjustment period. Used to change or nerf cards that are seen as problematic. 2 of such adjustment periods have come forth since this deck's conception. No changes what so ever. In fact not only did they do nothing they encouraged and nurtured the problem. In past adjustment periods they actively talked about why and why did they not make adjustments to specific cards. This time they shut down all discussion completely. The following quote by Cygames encompasses this new mind set completely.\"Although previous announcements have featured information on individual deck types' usage rates and win rates, we'll be omitting those figures this time around.\"I will admit that I loved this game. It was fun but simple and not too grindy or pay to win. But take notice, future consumer, that the developers have stopped giving any \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about their community and with the inclusion of a Gacha system for cosmetics the game has turned from a fun past time to a money grubbing parasite. A parasite designed to milk you of your money and not giving a damn about gameplay, balance or the community that they owe their popularity and success to.",

Cons: -Unlimited at this point in my book sucks since it's pretty much aggro, roach, & DShift everywhere with control decks almost not existing in it; I'd avoid it if you want to have fun imo. -1st/2nd turn can feel really worse than the other at times due to meta shifts (ie if aggro or combo is OP then turn 1 tends to feel OP or if control is OP then turn 2 tend to feel OP) -Not all decks are accessible to beginners to play or build due to complicated win conditions or cost of vials needed for the deck. -Ranked is all completely blinded best of ones which is pretty different from tournament formats for better or worse. -In take 2 some crafts tend naturally really good (looking at you sword) or really bad (looking at you rune) in the format which hurts the variety of the mode a bit, imo.  -Sometimes your favorite craft will just really struggle with a particular meta which can feel bad (though you can always play something else).On F2P: I think this game is probably one of the best done f2p games in terms of balancing what you can acquire and rate you can acquire things as a free players because of rewards systems:Pros: -3 Daily quests means ussually 1 pack per day at least if you do them all 3 as pvp ones. -Good amount of rupies given for 1st time clearing vs elite AIs. -Monthly reset on ranked rewards which don't depend on your rank reached, but rather how much you've won overall.  -Vial sysem is fairly generous I feel allows for reasonable crafting of cards you fail to pull from packs. -Free 10 packs given every expansion typically.   -Take 2 can reward packs if you do well  -Some good one time rewards from missions -Offers some alternative leaders for low cost or free -Possible to make viable budget decks for most classes -Rotation is great since reduces number of cards to worry about. -Any nerfed cards recieve full vial value temporary to compensate players.Cons: -Story rewards are pretty minimal of the most part -Some of the dailes can be rather long to complete and you can only reroll 1 daily of 3. -Getting the alternative leaders from packs is super RNG, and I'd say cost on avg 8~10k rupies per leader which is quite a lot for a free to play player, but they are just cosmetic.  -Getting the item to force animate a card of your choice is really costly for a free player. -Legendary rates are bad in general  -Some decks depend on a lot of legendaries -Unlimited can be scary for new players due to costs and range of expansions needed for decks. Overall if you'll looking for CCG with a japanese art style, that's more generous to f2p than other CCGs, or some depth and variety with a reasonable PVP ladder I'd highly recommend given the game a shot.",

                "text": "I have played this game since steam release and have about 1700 hours on steam.I am Grandmaster rank which is the highest possible in this game.While the game might seem pretty in terms of graphics with fairly simple and intuitive gameplay, especially if you are familiar with Hearthstone, I would not recommend this game unless you are very enthusiastic to play card games with anime artstyle.I will list the good and bad points of the game trying to keep this a short as possible.+ Fantastic anime style artwork + Game mechanics have potential for fun gameplay+ Unique playstyles for 8 available hero classes+ Variety of cosmetics and hero skins + Lots of free packs, arena tickets, various promotions+ Game is considered to be less RNG than Hearthstone+ New card sets released every 3 months+ Monthly balance checks and nerfs if needed+ Large prize pool of money in tournaments+ 2 different formats for constructed mode: \"Rotation\" ( available cards for the format are from basic set and 5 recent expansions/sets) and \"Unlimited\" (cards from all sets available for use) and arena format-Game became a lot less f2p friendly since release.It is no longer possible for f2p players to get full collection and it became hard to keep up with the meta ever since developers added mini-expansions to the sets - additional cards are added for every set after 1-2 months since release which is a blatant shameless cash grab as the mini-set includes golds and legendaries - the most rare and expensive to craft cards. As a casual player you will not be able to keep up with the sets.-Game can be extremely frustrating. This applies to most card games but this game is special in a certain way.Developers of this game Cygames are known to mess with various algorithms of their games such as changing percentages for getting certain pulls from packs (in one of their other games) which was scandalous enough to pass a new law in Japan, and possibly adjusting winrates for this game to make statistics look good. In this game the win/loss rates of the matches are weird at times  - one day you can get huge win streaks and the other day it will be impossible to win with the same deck which is mathematically improbable to say the least especially since this happens on constant basis. Do not bother taking this game seriously and do not pick it up if you have anxiety or do not want to get frustrated and angered on daily basis.- Unlimited format is a mess. Some decks in the game and expecially in \"Unlimited\" are poorly balanced and warp meta in such a way that certain archetypes are simply unplayable which limits design space, possible choices of decks to play and ultimately the fun you get out of playing this format. Some decks in the format are uninteractive and unfun to play against - \"D-shift\" combo deck removes your followers with spells and cycles cards until they assemble a combo to kill you on turn 7-8. Sounds fun to play against, how about a mirror match of two such decks?- Events and promotions are boring and a drag to play. \"Chest event\" requires you to grind the game for a lot of hours to get all daily chest rewards, Grand Prix is stressful, unoriginal (just an in-game tournament of sorts with constructed decks) and takes extra time too.- Very stong cards. You can run 3 copies of any card in your deck and most of the time one strong card will determine the outcome of the match as some cards  (especially legendary or gold rarity cards) can be disproportionally stronger in comparison to other cards. This makes the game more RNG prone as the luckier player who draws such cards is a lot more likely to win a game than a more skillful opponent who does not.- A lot of highroll decks, often times in the meta decks appear that you cannot win against if they draw the right cards and which lose pathetically if they do not draw the right cards. Matches are like coin flips decided on draw against such decks.- It is likely that this game will take a lot of your time and it will probably not be a relaxing experience in case you are looking for one.- Art style is good but not for everyone. - Reports you send in-game are ignored by the devs- Not possible to message in-game friends- No new arenas or background music have been added in a long time. - Game is popular in Japan but rather obscure in the westAll in all the future for this game looks bleak. I would suggest for you not to waste time on this game and find something else to play. If you are a masochistic anime fanatic like myself you might enjoy the game for some time, eventually you will be forced to spend money on this or burn out or just resent the experience of playing this game.",

You can play a few games a day and still hoard ingame money-The card design is so bad and so are the devs' balancing decisions. The game is utterly imbalanced and has the most frustrating mechanics I have ever seen.-The game is generally extremely rng-based. Your luck (and deck choice) has more say than your skill.-Some matches are downright unwinnable because of the aforementioned bad card design. Some matches are decided the moment the players knows whos 1st and 2nd.",

                "text": "So most of the negative reviews are due to the new expansion completely ruining the game since pretty much if you don't have the expensive top tier decks, you will lose and you know what... they are right. I personally love Shadowverse and play it daily for several hours. But why do I keep playing? Because I am one of those people with the highest tier decks and can win 9 out of 10 games no problem. Yeah it is fun for me but I see why everyone else is complaining about it. The devs are \"attempting\" to balance the over powered decks, they have pretty much killed Ramp Dragoncraft and \"attempted\" to some what nerf Midrange Shadowcraft. But guess what!!!! Midrange Shadowcraft still reigns surpreme! and I know this because I use that deck! Changing the cost of 1 card isn't going to stop it being over powered as \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665! I'm not saying that the whole deck needs to be nerfed, I am agreeing with the people saying it is not fair and not fun for everyone else. I started playing Shadowverse when the Darkness Evolved expansion came out. It was much simpler time back then and it really did show how Shadowverse was a great alternative to Hearthstone since Shadowverse does not rely on RNG stuff that much. But since there is a new expansion every 3 months, (Props to the devs for being pretty consistant) newer players are going to be lost and stepped on. Again props to the devs for being incredibly generous when it comes to packs, new players get like 15 packs for each expansion. The opinions Shadowverse is quite polarizing at the moment. I still love the game but I fully understand why people are s**ting on it.I wish steam had a mutual option because this game really is great but at this current state, it is hard to recommend. Hopefully sooner or later, Cygames will balance and revive their game to its former greatness.EDIT 17/07/17 as of the Wonderlands Dreams expansion, this review is dated but many of the points are still valid.EDIT 09/09/17 This game is beyond repair, it is a shell of it's former greatness and sadly this will never return to how great it was. Avoid this. Don't bother. Such a shame.",

I have read a lot of complaints about campers, so let me assure you, I am one of those campers. Hunt: Showdown allows for many a play style, like rushing in with a shotgun, duelling with pistols, or sniping from far away. There are at least a dozen weapons which allow a sniper playstyle, so don't complain about it. I have played computer games for nearly 40 years now, I'm 55, and I cannot (and would not want to) compete with the Fortnight Kiddies (like my sons...).So I will continue playing, I will continue sniping, and I will desperately try to push my KD past 0.60 - a task of herculean dimensions.Update: I have to correct myself - I'm not a camper, I'm a sniper. I run around, I follow the bounty carriers, I try to get into a favorable position, and then try to shoot them from a safe distance... but all the time I get shot by the campers. Damn those campers! So now I'll change my tactics: I try to become a close combat killer. I'm fairly certain that this step will halve my already measly KD, but whatever, as long as it's fun...",

                "text": "At 666 hours, I feel able to give a reasonable-enough review for folks looking into this game.Hunt is unforgiving.  The first dozen or so matches (maybe 5-10 hours) will be complete shocks and chaos.  Their tutorial is not great; if anything, it teaches you how NOT to play the game well.  But if you have a friend who's familiar with the game, or if you watch a few streamers/YouTubers, you'll quickly get a feel for this game.It's fun, edge-of-your-seat, brutally realistic action (as in, one bullet from someone you don't see or hear ends your match).  It's a game about stealth, movement, and strategy.  The weapons all feel well-balanced.  You can kill just as effectively with your starting guns (if not better) than the final-unlock automatic rifles and semi-modern tech handguns.Crytex listens to the community, they don't craft cheap DLC to belch out (I've bought most of it) just for the money.  There's arguments that some skins are \"PAY TO WIN\" because they might disappear into the forests better.  I find this is generally untrue for seasoned players, and feel like the devs are working ahrd to keep the community happy and the game thriving.If you are the type of person who got this far looking into Hunt - I think you're probably the kind of person who would enjoy it.  Give it more than 1-5 games to get used to it.  Remember, you don't win - you just live to die another day.",

                "text": "This is, simply put, my favourite game. There's nothing quite like Hunt out there. It's a difficult, challenging PvPvE game. You play as a bounty hunter tasked with killing a high value target in an area infested with some sort of dark magic. The only problem is, you're not the only hunter out there. You collect clues to locate the target, you kill the target, you banish the target.... then you have to escape the map with tokens proving it's you who killed it. Maps can hold 12 players, which means there will be 10 more people who are intent on stopping you leaving with that bounty. And almost everything you do can be heard by everyone else on the map, meaning you have to move as quickly as you can, whilst going as quietly as necessary. The gameplay loop is incredibly satisfying, with the right balance of risk and reward. Most things you do in a match earn you an amount of cash to take to the next lobby, where you can then either save for a rainy day, or buy higher tier equipment for your next loadout. But, anything you die with is lost to the bayou - hence the risk. If your hunter survives, they get experience and you can use that to buy some traits that make them marginally better for the next run out. This system sounds like a \"win more\" system, where success leads to a higher probability of success on the next run, and so it seems inevitable that the good get better equipment to be even more effective - so how can a new player break in?The answer is quite simple; all equipment has a situation where it's the best choice. The starting rifle has a larger magazine than most other guns in the game and shoots more quickly, so favours closer quarters fighting. The starting shotgun has the longest one-hit-kill range of all the shotguns. Ultimately, playing to your loadout's strengths and being better than your opponent has a FAR higher contribution to your success than the exact equipment everyone loaded in with.The barrier to a new player is therefore not an insurmountable equipment difference, it's learning the game. There are (currently) three VERY full maps, each of which is absolutely crammed with minutiae. It's about knowing how to move around compounds without triggering sound traps quickly. It's about knowing which directions you're actually vulnerable from. It's about knowing which sort of gun can shoot through that wooden wall you know they're crouched behind. It's about knowing that when the shot sounds like THAT, that means it's this specific gun and how far away they are. The burden of knowledge you have to accumulate to become proficient is very high. It's this burden of knowledge which is the thing you, as a potential buyer, have to consider. Are you prepared to get shot from places you don't understand for 20 hours? Are you prepared to be surprised by what their equipment did? You will likely die a lot before you get good. But when you DO become proficient, there is nothing like this game. Nothing replicates the thrill of you and a partner (or two) methodically outmanoeuvring another team and taking them down. Another (major) point in the \"pro\" column is the developer team. They are extremely active with the community, and listen to and implement suggestions from the community very proactively. They are continually improving the game and adding loads of content. I have bought a lot of the (cosmetic) DLC, purely to support the team, as I have gotten way more out of the game than the price I paid to get in.Despite every other shooter I try, I keep coming back to Hunt. As long as there are other hunters to go up against, I think I might never stop.",

                "text": "This is an OLD REVIEW that has been updated to the full release version of Hunt: Showdown. Many things have changed, and the review is horribly outdated, so I have done my best to include all of the new updates in the review.- The atmosphere of the game is amazing. You can really get immersed in the world alone, depsite the lack of NPCs or voice acting.- Graphics to this game look fantastic, even on low settings.- Weapons feel good, shoot good, and make you feel powerful with each shot. Also includes bullet speed, and one-shot headshots up to reasonable distances depending on ammo type.- A leveling system, complete with weapons, perks, abilities, and consumables to unlock and equip, and a near-endless variety to pair and test out together.- Lots of weapon and character variety. From rifles with bayonets to silenced revolvers. From a noob cowboy with plain pants and a shirt, to legends wearing black dusters covered in skulls, trinkets, and scars.- Enemy AI variety is good, making you adapt to their fighting styles and how to counter them effectively. Some enemies rush you mindlessly, but others will sit back and try to take you out at a distance. The AI is simple, but effective at their job.- The sound design. From the crunching of glass under your feet, to crows taking off when people are too close. The way the barn creaks when you take a step. The distant gunshots and being able estimate how far they are by the sound. Everything revolves around sound, and the sound is beautiful.- Weapon balancing. Every weapon this game is viable. The later weapons may be more powerful, sure, but you have a reduced ammo pool and ammo replenishment compared to earlier weapons, longer reload times, longer pauses in between shots, and a higher price point. You want to be able to keep an enemy suppressed for days? There's a weapon for that. you want to stay calm, and pick them off with a single, well-placed headshot? There's a weapon for that. You want a single-action revolver with a stock and a short range scope? There's a weapon for that... for some reason.- Random gameplay. Not in the bad way, either. One game you might not hear a peep the entire round, but the next, gunshots are ringing out from every single direction. You never truly know what's going to happen when you drop into the bayou.- Having an objective. Oh my god, having an objective. It's what separates this game from PUBG and Escape from Tarkov. Having that tangible, ever-present quest in-game, that requires multiple steps to complete most times, makes the game into more than a PvP experience. It's not something that you can be sneaky about most of the time. You have to reveal to EVERYONE where you are to complete your objective.- The price. This comes down to personal preference, and whether or not you like the amount of content so far. 2 different levels with multiple areas to explore, different times of day, 3 unique bosses, and a metric ton of challenges and weapons to unlock through gameplay.- The coop. While it is insanely fun, it can be a real pain if you join with a random partner over and over. There is also the choice of playing with group of 3 rather than 2, but can be opted out of if you would just like to play in a duo. This depends on whether or not you have someone to play the game with, and I would highly recommend picking it up if you have a confirmed partner to play with.- The bosses. The bosses themselves are great, but the variety isn't, with only 3 bosses to go after. This depends on whether you really care about the boss fights, or whether it's the PvP and world that interests you.- As far as I can tell, you need a beast of a rig to run this thing properly. It doesn't mean that you won't be able to play, but you'll be confined to playing on lower settings. Not a huge loss overall, but some people are all about dem gwaffics and framerates. The game seems to be getting more and more optimised with each update, so it'll hopefully only get better from here.- The community. I'll go into detail on this later in it's own section, because it's a tough one to cover in a few sentences.- The loading. Loading screens are long, which is understandable, since the map is massive. The in-game loading of objects and enemies, isn't. Having a hotspot be completely void of life, then spawn in 3 tough AI enemies 30 feet away both ruins the immersion and your planning from time to time.- The solo play. While you are dropped in without a partner, other people can still join with a partner, putting you at an obvious disadvantage, making solo play quite difficult. You do get a bonus for doing this, but it normally won't apply to you, since you'll end up dead. Not impossible to do, but takes a lot more skill with a meagre offering to balance it out.- The updates. Every update normally causes some type of havoc, whether it be textures getting broken, rewards not loading properly, or server disconnects. Every update seems to play around with something unintentional, which is probably thanks to the spaghetti code that's held together with masking tape and wrapping paper. Expect a few... weird... occurrences to pop up from time to time.- The learning curve. If you don't have an experienced teammate to play with, there is a lot of trial-and-error you will be doing, and you will be stomped into the mud. Over and over. I would definitely suggest watching tutorials or videos on youtube on how to actually play, because there are quite a few concepts that aren't explained anywhere in-game. When should you shoot AI? How does poison work exactly? Why did someone throw a lantern at my \"dead\" friend? This isn't Call of Duty. You won't know everything, and it will be the death of you. Shrug it off, grit your teeth, and jump back in for revenge.This community should  be avoided for the first little while. While they can be helpful, a large amount have found the mentality of \"This game has been ruined by those filthy  gamers\" due to new updates from the devs. It hasn't really been \"casualized\", but has been made different from what it once was. Balancing is a fickle thing, and some people would still rather have the game be reverted back to the 0.6 update, or even the 0.1 alpha.Every single corner of the reddit, steam forums, or elsewhere, are going to be coated in people complaining about how base mechanics and weapons are overpowered, while others claim that they're underpowered. Burning a downed hunter (which slowly removes him from the match unless his teammate revives him in time) is vilified by a lot of people in this game. They cite it as an unfair and stupid tactic, labelling the people who do this \"insta-burners\". Then you have the crowd who oppose this idea, saying \"Is there any reason to not give yourself an obvious advantage over your opponent?\".There's also a lot of hate surrounding the \"camping\" in this game. This game with have hectic, tense moments, where you run and gun your way through the woods to extraction. But... you'll also have times where the gameplay slows to a crawl, because 2 teams refuse to move. The team inside the house knows that, with their shotguns, they'll be at a disadvantage if they leave their cover to take on the rifle users outside, and the team outside realises the opposite. Therefore, both teams sit on their hands for ~30 minutes without doing anything. This gameplay scenario is looked down upon from every angle, but it's because people want the other group to make a mistake. Both teams are technically making the right decision. you decide on how you want to play, not the community.Overall, despite its flaws,the game is surprisingly stable, and surprisingly fun, for those who can run it. I would suggest picking it up, but I would also suggest picking it up with a friend, or be prepared to get destroyed your first few games.",

It's easy to make new friends in random queue, most of my steam friends list comes from this game. As you play you'll gain characters and money, but you'll also lose those things in the blink of an eye. Friends last longer and they are more valuable.",

Recently i finally made the plunge, and it's been fantastic. The beginner experience has not been nearly as bad as i expected, and we have killed teams and extracted with bounties plenty of times so far, and it's always exhilarating.Hunt: Showdown is a badass design package with very clear vision behind it. The visuals are gritty, gloomy and monstrous, with amazing 3D design and 2D art for things like perks. The gameplay is relatively slow and methodical, and you gotta weigh the value of your actions like shooting and running before you perform them, while still keeping pace. This is pronounced more by the long reload times, and the amazing audio design. Everything you do makes noise to varying degrees, which makes you a player magnet if you decide to run and gun or \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 up and make noise by accident. Sound in this game is your best friend and your worst enemy, and learning how to use it to your advantage is super cool and will improve your chances the most. There's a lot more to say about this game but there are plenty of good reviews out there. I'd recommend checking out  for a solid impression. I'd love to see the playerbase grow and the franchise expand, so this is just me trying to peddle it to you. Big recommendation.",

The gameplay loop, the tension, the tactical options, the gunplay, the graphics, the stress, the thematics, the teamwork, the freedom of playstyle, the attention to detail, the skill ceiling and THE SOUND DESIGN all just blend together to make the most unique and wonderfull gaming experiences I've had in my life. The developers really have their ear to the ground and do their absolute best to balance and serve the community to the best of their abilities. This feels like a love child, and it is nurtured. I recommend this game to anyone who is even remotely interested, and I promise it will deliver if you are up for getting beamed in the face during your ever so expanding learning experience. The playerbase is growing with every month and it fills me with joy, as this game really deserves all the love it gets. Don't get me wrong, its a HARD \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 game.

Enjoying the challenge and making progress both in terms of my character unlocks and skill level. You have to hunt a demonic entity whilst fighting/avoiding various mobs with a selection of weapons and toolsThen I got dumped into PvP mode. Now about 50% of games I have played have been with evenly skilled teams and some of my team mates have not been complete d***s. However,  50% have been quite the opposite, and this is where the game falls down. Someone shooting you as you soon as you spawn, camping at the top of stairs with a shotgun, or at the extraction point killing you 1 second away from safety. Make this game more frustrating than fun.When you get a 'good' game though, this ticks so many boxes, so I am giving it a thumbs up.However, I think the only way to make this game great would be to add a co-op PvE mode with optional bots. So casual players like myself can choose to have fun and not frustration.",

                "text": "Steam keeps on bothering me to write a review for this game so here's one , i guess.You might have heard this ' there's nothing like it on the market ' description of Hunt : Showdown and frankly i must admit that it is mostly spot on. This game is pretty unique and intriguing mix of PVE and PVP within setting which i frankly doubt i ever really saw used in a video game before. We are talking about end of 19th century Louisiana  mixed with paranormal horror activity.If you would take a super brief look at Hunt's gameplay loop one could mistakenly assume that it is a battle royal game and while there are few similarities between the two, Hunt has a really original and unique gameplay loop i have never seen done before in a video game.Core idea here is that you enter a map , which is 1km x 1km square , either alone , in a duo or a trio of hunters and your main goal is to look for clues to locate a boss , kill him , banish him and extract with a bounty. Sounds simple enough , right? But that is there fun actually behinds. Besides having to contend with PVE part of the game , that is various kind of AI controlled zombies ( for the lack of better word ) , number of sound traps like injured animals ,crows ,caged chickens and dogs ( of whom all make loud noises then disturbed in turn giving out your location and even direction you are moving in ) , you are also not alone in a pursuit of that bounty. That is there PVP part of game kicks in .Even  though this is  PVPVE game , PVE is here only to slow down you rather than being a real threat. Real threat comes from other players who also have same goal as you. Real 'meat' of this game is PVP and while you can choose and avoid PVP all together , you will not have much fun while doing so. Bosses , again , are mostly there to funnel players into the same area to initiate PVP fights.PVP is rough and tough in Hunt. From what i understand earlier in it's life it was even more hardcore , but even at it's current state this game is not for faint hearted folks. Kill times are low , weapons are mostly single shots so each shot counts ( fitting the settings and time period ) and while on a surface this could look like a simple point and shoot situation there are dozens upon dozens of systems and things to consider in each firefight so you will need tens and in some cases hundreds of hours to really start to feel what are you doing.  I wont lie to you , for first 20 or 30 hours i was pretty much cowering behind stuff in each firefights in essence being a glorified decoy for enemy players while my team mate hopefully was doing something less useless.  Hunt can be really stressful with steep learning curve, perma death ( losing your hunter with all his/her equipment you spent so much money on ) and never knowing who has your in their scopes while crossing open fields but it also can be so very rewarding when you survive a final server wide gunfight on your last bullet and out of healing items. Even 140 hours in some of the firefights leaves me with my heart pounding which is a rare occasion after playing video games and FPS game for more than 25 years now.There are of course bunch of technical issues, questionable decisions from the dev team and other negatives associated with any competitive online game so be aware of that before you decide to enter Bayou .",

                "text": "After \"testing\" the game for about 100 hours i want to write a review, first of all i went into this game with quite a hype, so my expectations were pretty high and i have to say it lives almost completly up to my hype, lets start with the prosGameplay: many people say its a new take on the battle royal genre, i'd say thats 20% true, hunt tries to be its own game with other goals than battle royal games, the focus is highly on pvp but you can avoid that and go for the pve experience if you really want to, which sadly results in less xp but i think thats a fair trade Graphic: its a crytek game so yea, the graphic and details, specially for a 30\u20ac/$ game are id say almost insane ( but it has a con to it which i will mention later)Map and enemies: the map it quite big, i didnt expect a witcher 3 map in terms of size but the map in hunt is still big enough for the type of game and for you to feel like you'll need hours from point A to B, but the details in this map, holy, this map is so detailed that i've never seen a map where theres so much love and detail in every corner, sure there are some areas where you can go under a roots but thats rare.For the enemies? they are pretty detailed to, even so detailed that its almost kind of disgusting if you take a closer look at them, flesh falling of everywhere, rotting skin hanging from their body revealing bones, hives growing out of the ribcage busting it open, maggots that eat the skin and so on, there aren't to much enemy-type at the moment and most of them only have small detail changes ( hives wear different dresses ) but im sure if time goes on they will have a good variety like they have with the basic zimbies (grunts)Hunters: like with the map and the enemies, the hunters are pretty detailed too, besides different skin colors they have different clothes, which all look super detailed even on medium setting (<- this coming up as a con. later )Weapons: there aren't to much weapons at the moment but if you read it to this point you know whats coming, they are all highly detailed in terms of look, functions and soundnow i want to adress the cons of this gameOptimization: as much as i like to praise the graphics, they are a bit of a con too, the optimization in this game at the moment ( there was a perfomance patch so it is a bit better now ) isnt that great, if you dont have a highend beast of a pc you wont get to play this game on highest settings with stable 60 or even just 30 fps, most people will have 30-60 on low to middle settings with the average pc Balancing: well i had to come to this point because the balancing even tho its quite good, has its flaws, most and foremost the difference between tier 1 and tier 3 hunters, i dont mean that its op that tier 3's have better camouflage because thats fine, the difference in loadout, perks* and  starting hp is what makes it hard for tier 1 and 2 hunters to keep up if you're not a highly experienced player, weapons, for example  the autonagant (rarely used due to its price) is a close to midrange monster and you wont have any chance fighting someone who has this weapon and knows what he does, that means that there are hunters who use this weapon (1 in 30 games, pretty rare) and wipe the whole server and the price (999$) doesnt really make up for it because its quite easy to make that money if there noone left *Perks: some hightier perks are slightly imbalanced, most perks are  unlocked at low levels and most of them are almost essential for your hunter, but stuff like the fanning perk ( lets you fire a singleaction revolver in a way higher rate of fire, google fanning for more infos )are unlocked pretty late but they could give lower tier hunters a bit of a advantage and they could keep up with higher tier weapons Shooting mechanic: at the moment the shootouts are more or less a \"who can run faster from right to left\"-fiesta , in a game this slowpaced, there should be a downside to moving while aiming, but as it is right now, your weapon sways just a little and its quite easy to get hitssome minor cons: AI movement is quite stale, they walk from point A to B and only leave their route if they're alerted, im no programmer but i think its possible to implement a point C and then switch up the way they walk maybe? just a thoughtthe realod of some weapons bothers me a bit, im talking about the specter ( pumpaction shotgun ), the dolch (autoloading pistol) and the mosin nagant ( bolt action rifle ) they all lose one bullet uppon realoading, the perk \"pump-jockey\" is a fix for the specter but to be honest, if you have the perk equiped your hunter will take the unused round and put it back in because without the perk it gets tossed away, i kinda think the perk is a bit unnecessary, for the other 2 guns, well theres no perk you'll always lose one round uppon realoading, im mean technically you could pick them up and put them back in but yea, just a minor thing thats bothering me, not gamebreaking or anything well as it stands right now, the game is in a pretty solid place, its a hardcore not really forgiving game that takes some inspiration from the battle royal games and makes them harder, its a really fresh wind in the shooter genre with only cod bf like games or battle royal, all in all i can recommend this game",

I primarily play Arcade Shooters like COD, where I just charge in guns blazing for kills and if I die its fine, I respawn. I also do not enjoy BRs because you spend a lot of time scavaneging to get killed by a sniper in some corner. Hunt not only has that high risk and reward, but the death is perma i.e you lose your hunters and gear when you die.So why did I end up loving this game?I will be honest, the first few games was brutal and if its your first time in this genre, it will be for you too. I was playing this game like I play COD, see a guy and then charge hoping to land a kill. You CANNOT play this game that way and it was stupid of me to play that way. After the first few games I realized, the game's main foxcus is not the shooting, its your tactical gameplay. I was not happy that the gunfights were so short, but then I realized, it's supposed to be that way coz the game is not about the shootout, its about how you tactically reach to that shgootout. Gun fights are not supposed to drag out, the stealthily creeping up to your enemy and landing the pefect shot is what is supposed to drag out. The perfect game play is you and your team mates spending a lot of time to get the perfect position and kill your enemy with one shot. That's the fun part. Once you realize that, you will see how fun the game isThe sound design and accuracy is undoubtedly one of the bests, so you gotta be careful to not step on branches, glasses or scare off the birds coz the enemy will not only know of your existence but will also know where you are coz the directional audio is very accurate. Every step, movement, bullet matters and you have to treat it that way. It doesnt mean you cannot change your playstyle, for ex there are double pistols, shotguns, melee etc that you can use for a more action packed gameplay, but even that you have to plan out well.Hunt Showdown plays a very specific way and it outshines in doing that. I highly reccomend this game.",

                "text": "Hunt Showdown is not a fair game, and that\u00b4s Ok.Hunt is not designed to be a balanced shooter in the traditional sense. Games like Valorant, and Counter Strike with their limited maps and short rounds are designed for teams of equally powerful members fighting each other. Hunt is different. Balance in this game is achieved by the player and not by game mechanics or gun stats. The cheapest weapons in the game all have their place and are effective in the right circumstances. Because of the freedom we have in each game it is up to you to create those advantageous circumstances for yourself.If you are engaged in a fair fight, than both players have \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 up.Where an overpowered weapon becomes truly OP in games that force you to engage in relatively even fights, Hunt provides the freedom to change the odds. Weapons are not balanced against each other. But that is ok, because how you can play can shift the balance in your favor.Pick weapons and consumables that suit your style. Set traps for enemies. Engage at ranges favorable to you. Ambush opponents. Don't be afraid to disengage. Reposition frequently. Patience and preparation are rewarded and situational awareness is king. The most accurate player in the game can't beat you if you kill him before he sees you.The fact that the lowest scum like me can kill a good (very good) Player with a Winfield or Sparks-Sniper simply by being patient and observant is the best part of the game. Matches feel like you are legitimately hunting someone. Every action you take has consequences. I've run from many 3 vs 1 fights after screwing up the headshots. No one can kill you if you're out of sight.Don't wanna go up alone against 3 Players or against a Avtomat? Go for a long distance. Ambush them, shoot them while they're climbing ladders, reviving or healing, shooting something else or reloading.Fairplay has no place here you are a Hunter (Bountyhunter) not the good fairy.And that's why I love this game!",

                "text": "is an early access first-person shooter with Battle Royale style gameplay ( though; it's hard to define its genre) whose mastery of tension, theming, and tactical components has birthed a game where every match is as exhilarating as the next. wants to make you think like a hunter, and incorporates as many of our senses as it can. Unfortunately, our hands are occupied with the mouse and keyboard so we\u2019re left with sight and sound and my god has  nailed it in this respect.The combination of a highly reactive landscape, excellent visual information, and sound design that\u2019s so crisp I can hear my opponents picking their nose from 20 yards is masterfully executed enveloping a player into the game. This is the area where I think  separates itself from many of the other  or first-person shooters.To put this into perspective I\u2019ll set up a metaphorical scenario. You are crouched outside a building and you suspect someone to be nearby. Here\u2019s a list of some of the things you are likely to hear: crows, duck, chickens, dying horses, caged dogs, and all monsters will make noise when you get close to them. If the other person is not being sneaky, crows and ducks will also fly away, giving other visual information. You could also hear: footsteps on different terrain, doors opening, engines, hanging bottles that chime when knocked, and broken glass. There are so many audio cues that you can hear, perking your attention. This is what gives the player a feeling of real empowerment, making them feel like a tracker as they stalk their opposition using the endless number of audio ques.\u2019s sound design also allow for an eerie, dismal atmosphere to set in.Moments of intense combat puncture through the sombre ambience, screams and cries from hives carry across baron fields and morbid yards, and the silence is peaceful yet tense. With tuned ears, about any noise you make can turn you from predator to prey; from a hunter to the hunted.This is a game that on a surface level looks like a Battle Royale style game but plays .You have something on the line, your hunter, your gear, and the bounty that you so rightly deserve. The potential of losing all of that makes you question every door and every window you come across. The tension this creates is immense, your heart pounds knowing there\u2019s another hunter in the next room. You can hear him, which means he can hear you. It plays out like a strategic game of chess, you move into an advantageous position, the other hunter does the same putting you in a mental checkmate. You have no idea what gun he has, if he\u2019s alone, and if his partner is soon to arrive. You either have to take him on or leave him and hope someone else does the dirty work for you.Teamwork encompasses many aspects, but it begins with selecting your team.There are many ways to play:- Solo queue.- Queue with premade group.- Queue with 1 random.- Queue with 2 randoms.Hunt: Showdown uses , that other teams may be able to hear.It is not disrespectful for a teammate to not respond, and  of the possibility of other teams being nearby.The pinging tool is widely used, both in premades and random queues. This allows you to point at whatever is under your crosshair and share it with your team only. Other teams cannot hear or see pingsSo using the pinging system is a very good way to communicate. sees you playing as a bounty hunter in the  swamps, sent to hunt down and collect bounties that have been set on ghastly horrors. In a match your goal is to find clues to locate a monster lurking in one of the map\u2019s compounds, kill the monster, and banish them back to whatever hell it came from.There\u2019s a catch though, there are eight or nine other players that are trying to do the same, and will stop at nothing to retrieve that bounty all for themselves.Even if you can do the impossible and banish the beast you still have to escape with the bounty in your grasp. introduces a thematic natural way to condense players into one area using an objective style system, you will need to find three clues to deduce where the bounty is dwelling. With each clue the number of possible places the monster is hiding narrows.This leads the players to a smaller area where chances of encountering other players is greatly increased but does not force players together like  or  does, which feels more realistic.So, you got the bounty and got out alive.You will get rewarded with an in-game currency that you can spend on better weapons, tools, and consumables. Your hunter will also gain experience based on activities you have done throughout the match allowing you to unlock and equip different perks.If any consumables were used you will need to restock on those consumables, and if by chance you lost a health bar you can replenish it.Well I\u2019m afraid to say that  is no longer with you.All of his equipment, tools and guns, all gone.Take comfort in knowing that his memory will live on in your . There is a separate counter for experience points (bloodline) and will allow you to unlock improved guns, perks, etc., similar to how a  game would. This permadeath mechanic adds so much tension into every second of hunt. No one wants to lose all their stuff, ever.Losing a character is one thing but permanent scarring of a hunter can also occur. If you get gunned down during a heated gunfight your partner can pick you up but it will permanently lower your character\u2019s health by one bar. This can be recovered by spending perk points between games, but it should not be taken lightly. Additionally, if you catch on fire due to another player\u2019s attack or an environmental effect you slowly begin to burn. If the flames are not snuffed out you could also permanently lose a health bar.Until you are level 15, everything comes for free.And when you hit level 16, one out of the four hunters you get each game, will be free (and all the equipments that comes with him too).If you're looking for something absolutely new which isn't just a mindless FPS this might be the game for you. Very intense and strategic.If you just run around and shoot, in most cases, you will get shot or get killed by players, zombies, dogs or any other monster.Sneaking and communicating with your partner is the key to success (unless you play the \"Solo\" gamemode).It's still in Early Access and has some issues but there are regular patches that fixes them and overall performance has improved. This might be my Game of the Year 2018.I already spent 40+ hours and even if there are only two large map (for now), it's not getting boring yet.Gameplay: 95/100Audio: 100/100Environment: 100/100",

                "text": "When I first played this game, I tried it alone; through training and after I lost my training wheels, and it . I would sneak around and either wait on other players as they killed bosses and attempt to pick them off (and fail) or I got into gunfights and lost.Then I tried matchmaking with random duos - half the time high or fellow low levels wouldn't bother playing due to my immediately obvious low level and skill (some kind of incentive for experienced players to take a low level player into a match might help there, @devs), but the other occasions when an experienced player took me along - . Up to twelve players in a match, but you  as the game will not tell you. Everyone spawns on the edges of the map, but unlike battle royale-esque shooters, the prominent factor that drives players together is not a zone that forces them to interact, it's the promise of risk vs reward. To get the in-game rewards, there are many AI enemies to face off against, including 3 variants on a boss battle. Up to two of the bosses can be present in any one match, and players are tasked with finding clues to track them down.  Killing the bosses isn't enough, as they drop 2 'bounties' that must be extracted for maximum gain. Each player can only carry 1 bounty of each type, encouraging (at minimum) each duo to aim to kill one boss, grab a bounty each, and extract. There are limited areas to extract, and everyone on the server can see where they are.However after killing each boss, there is a process which delays the players in picking up the bounties, and also displays the boss' position to the rest of the server. As soon as the bounties are picked up, the players' positions are displayed to the rest of the server. Start 'banishing' the dead boss to get the bounties? The server sees where you are. Pick up the bounties? Not only does the server see where you are, but they might be able to reasonably guess which exit you are taking. If you have the bounties, you play a mind game in fending off other teams whilst getting out safely. If you don't have the bounties then you are hunting other teams that  have the bounties by guessing their exit, assaulting them head on whilst they wait on the 'banish' phase, or attempting to ambush them somewhere in between it all. Better yet, you sneak up on another unexpecting team and wipe them, negating competition early on!: Your gunshots, or triggering aspects within the game known as 'sound traps' (e.g. a flock of crows is startled by you, flying off loudly) will alert other hunters to your location. If you ever do come head to head with another team, then are they flanking you when you can't see them? Given that teams can range from 1-3 people, when you only killed a single player, do they have a buddy? When you and another team both banish at the same time, but they don't pick up their bounties, are they coming for you? There is a constant, tense stream of questions you ask yourself as you play. There is so much detail in each map, and within the interiors of the buildings. The game is dripping with lore and the aesthetic of the weird west, and it is really enjoyable to experience. Hearing another player's character breath as they wait in a bush a few feet from you (via the wonders of binaural audio design) is a tense feeling you don't often experience.It's stressful, you will likely die and lose your stuff a lot. HOWEVER, do not let this grind you down, you learn a lot from failure in my experience. A low skill player can still kill a high skill player with starting weapons. A new player can still outwit an experienced player if they are smart enough. There is definitely a steep learning experience to this game but there is a high skill ceiling and experience that I haven't experienced in any other title in this genre. I have not even hit the first prestige rank so I make no claim to being an expert with this game, but I do my best to take new players under my wing in a random matchmake and teach them the basics that I had to learn myself. When I play in a team and we click, and some beautiful gunfights come together: win or lose, I have a lot of fun.",

                "text": "This is one of those games that I wish you could choose a middle option between Recommended and Not Recommended for. There is nothing out there like Hunt, so it's just hard to tell at first glance whether or not you'll like it. Me, I picked it up because I really dig the 19th century horror aesthetic. I really thought it was a very different game when I got it, and it took a long time for me to understand what it really is all about.I recommend it only on the condition that you do some research about it first. Watch a stream, read some reviews, check out the Reddit, and then buy the game only when you're absolutely convinced you're in. It'd really help if you can convince a friend or two to play with you because 1) communication is key, 2) having friends to laugh with will ease the anxiety and sting of losing a hunter. Otherwise, either try to join sub-communities (Twitch streamers' Discords) or prepare to play with randoms who can be really cool, really bad (even worse than my .68 KD self), really try-hard, or really unresponsive.--------------------------------------------------Hunt's a PvPvE game where you roll a hunter, set them up with items and weapons, and then go off into one of two (soon to be three) maps. Your objective is to find the boss monster located in one of the map's many compounds, kill it, and get out. On the way to your goal, you will run into a small variety of mobs and, if you're (un)lucky enough, the other players on the map.There are only ever at most 12 players in a match. Because the maps are large and everybody has the same objective, this means people are getting funneled toward the same point. So, fights can get real chaotic. The thing that makes this interesting is that guns hit very hard and fire very slowly (except for one or two exceptions that make the folks on Reddit reeee). The name of the game is patience and deliberate tactical decisions. One bad move can knock you straight back into lobby. To make things even more nail-biting, your hunter dies permanently, and rolling a new hunter can cost you.So, in the face of all of this, what do you do? Learn your guns, learn the maps, learn to \"see with your ears\", and be patient. 250 hours in, and I'm still doing all of this.Most reviews on this game will likely point this out. The low TTK, the slow-firing guns, and other mechanics all come together to make a very punishing experience. If I'm not mistaken, map design is centered around making sure you're never truly safe from enemy shots. Sound plays a major role in the game, so you have to learn how to move effectively and quietly, or else you'll have hunters springing ambushes on you. Each gun in the game has a unique look and feel, adding an extra layer of complexity to an already dense game.So, avoid this game if you don't think you'll have the time needed to learn it. You won't have fun if you're not getting better. Having a friend teaching or learn along with you will make the process of learning the basics a lot less painful.Hunt Showdown being a multiplayer game, one has to be wary of how predatory the microtransactions (because there always are) can be. Good news: there is no pay-to-win. Bad news: all of the DLC hunters and guns look really freaking cool.The game is also pretty generous with its premium currency. You get a small amount per game--something in the range of 1-12 depending on your performance (kills, objectives, etc.). It adds up over the hours, so you can definitely make a case for saving up to get that one skin you want.As with every game with a large player-base, your mileage may vary. Hunt isn't HUGE, mind you, but it's big enough that most players will be entirely anonymous to you. So, of course, there are jerks and bigots and try-hards and trolls. They are definitely in the small minority, but a glance at the game's Discord can make the community seem unwelcoming. You will see a lot of people asking for 2+ KD players with 300+ hours (I'm at 250 with .68 KD :s).But, really, the Hunt community is pretty cool. The nicest, most welcoming folks can be found hanging around Twitch streamers. The more experienced players tend to be so beyond caring about winning (they've been broken) that games with them are some of the most chilled out experiences I've ever had. Your best bet as a new player will be to go into the Discord or a streamer's chat, and and just introduce yourself as a new player looking to learn the ropes.By the way, matchmaking is elo-based, so prepare to end up in games where you're totally outmatched just because you killed somebody with higher KD.I adore this game, but it took me about 40 hours for it to really click with me. Until then, I stayed for the aesthetic, atmosphere, and that sweet feeling of running out with the bounty. After that 40 hour mark, I was hooked. By that point, I had prestiged for the first time (it can take a lot less time if you win a lot). This is the first time I've ever prestiged in any shooter, and so the snowball started rolling.There are some times where I'm utterly demoralized. Other times, I'm riding on the highest high I've ever felt in a video game.",

                "text": "Talk about an atmospheric gameplay experience, Hunt Showdown is a gorgeous horror shooter stealth game with the sole intent of having the players immersed in a chilling western environment where each single match could be the last.Right off the bat, this is not a game that belongs in the oversaturated Battle Royale market. No. Hunt Showdown is a very unique arena shooter that involves both PvE and PvP. In fact, the remarkable aesthetic and art style are breathtakingly amazing. Combined with the absolutely fantastic sound design, the world presented is awe-inspiring and scary beyond imagination.With only 1 opened world map, 2 bosses and only a handful of enemies, there just doesn't seem to be a lot of variety at the moment. The gunplay, on the other hand, is marvelous! Though the combat is slow paced, the shooting is one of the best aspects of the game, making you really concentrate your fire when needed.All the many details implemented, such as the different weather style, unnerving sounds (damn twig snaps), and even the user interface, make it a special kind of horror. All throughout the match there is never a death count or actual indication of what exactly is going down. You might hear gunshots in the distance thinking people are duke it out, but you won't know the outcome. That makes for really good tension.It feels to me like Hunt Showdown could end up being a niche title, not a bad thing, because even though the progression system is very rewarding, the perma death element ( meaning that once the hunter you've recruited gets killed off, they stay dead) might not be everyone's cup of tea.Honestly, Crytek have a lot to improve here, especially when it comes to the performance, but it has the potential of being a very solid multiplayer game. Give it a try!",

Had the gunfight been the choreography of a modern western film it would have been a great action scene but being in the actual gunfight makes it all the more amazing. The intensity of it, the tension of the good guys possibly loosing, the satisfaction of hitting a shot to kill an enemy, and the relief of the good guys finally winning despite the odds are all greatly amplified when you are one of the cowboys.I saved my friend at the last moment from a charging bayonet with a perfect shot to the chest that sent the assailant sprawling.  Moments later a loud blast went off as a man burst through a door five feet from me.  I was caught reloading my single shot breach loading rifle as he began firing his duel revolvers.  Expecting to die any moment I hear my friend whom I had just saved fire, killing the man.   So if you want to feel like one of the magnificent seven or the man with no name then this is the game for you.The major drawback is the lack of help for new players.  The game is extremely complex, very difficult, and the tutorials do very little to help.  The best way I have found to learn is to shadow experienced teammates, if they stick around after seeing that your new and probably suck.  One would think quick play would be the place to learn but because its single player and all the load outs players end up with are random I have found it is even more punishing.",

You will be facing off against 8 or 9 other players depending on whether or not you brought a companion. These other people and yourself are all scouring the map for clues that help you narrow down where the massive monsters are lurking, waiting for you to Hunt them Down. Other players are not your only imminent danger while you\u2019re traversing the land, there are hordes of monsters around every corner.  The game does an absolutely incredible job of immersing you and giving you a constant sense of tension. There\u2019s hardly a lull in the sounds of this world, you hear dogs barking, crows flying, zombies walking, gunshots blasting, and the majority of the sounds have an actual reason for happening. You have to be constantly be paying attention to where and why you are hearing things, were those crows from an enemy running through them? Is that zombie grunting because it just got attacked? You will always be on edge wondering these things, but not because the game is trying to trick or scare you, it\u2019s always providing accurate information of what is happening, you just have to learn how to interpret it correctly. Before you enter into a match you are given some options, you have a few Hunters to choose from who each come equipped with different weapons, tools, or passive abilities to aid you on your mission. If the Hunters do not have exactly what you would prefer to use, you have a set amount of money that you can use to gear your character the way you would prefer. As you level up and collect bounties from your matches you will earn more money that you can use to bring better equipment in the future. However you do not get to keep your Hunters and equipment forever. If your Hunter is killed for any reason during a match (other than a game crash) then they will be permanently lost along with anything they were carrying. This certainly can be harsh for newer players, but the developers are constantly working on ways to help ease new players into the experience, without ruining the hardcore aspects that the main playerbase loves. Crytek are utilizing the Early Access phase of their game much better than the majority of games I\u2019ve followed. They are pushing out updates nearly every week, with major content being added at least every month. Even just since the game started in early access it\u2019s performing significantly better, they\u2019ve eliminated hundreds of bugs, added a massive amount of gameplay features, equipment, passives, a new map, the list goes on. Hunt: Showdown is absolutely a very passionate project for Crytek, and they are doing everything they can to listen to the community while trying to build the game that they\u2019re envisioning. Hunt: Showdown is a hardcore, PvPvE (Player VS. Player VS. Environment) game that focuses on hunting down AI boss targets and escaping the match alive. Matches consist of 10 players, either solo or duo, and are limited to an hour in length. You will choose and equip a character before you enter the match, and you are able to loot weapons from other fallen players. During the match you have the ability to see \u201cclues\u201d at every compound on the map that all other players will also be drawn to. As you activate these clues it narrows down sections of the map and eventually shows you exactly where your boss target is, currently it can either be a large pig butcher abomination or an incredibly quick, massive spider made of human body parts. If you manage to defeat the monster and escape with it\u2019s bounty alive, you are given a large chunk of currency that you are able to better equip your hunter in your next matches. A quick play mode was also just recently added that shakes up the typical formula a bit. You can only join it with random characters, but they\u2019re completely free, and it\u2019s entirely focused on PvP rather than the match being about killing a boss. The UI functions well with few bugs, however some sections of it can be a bit confusing. They are constantly changing and improving it, but sometimes they leave areas of it untouched when they have features planned that will completely change the purpose of that menu. I have had few issues with it, but it\u2019s certainly not perfect yet. As for the controls, they may feel a little strange at first. Particularly the way you fire your weapon or use tools. Your character wont fire his gun just by pressing the Left-Mouse Button. You have to first hold Right-Click to raise your weapon, this will let you hip-fire by pressing Left-Click, or if you would like to be more accurate, you have to continue holding Right-Click then tap Shift to aim down your sight, then you can Left-Click to fire as you would be used to in other shooters. It seems weird at first, but you\u2019ll find it works well for this style of game. All keys are also easily rebindable in the menu if anything isn\u2019t to your liking by default. Crytek are known for their impressive visuals in games and they certainly do not disappoint in Hunt: Showdown. The game looks absolutely outstanding on any graphic settings, and their thematic choice holds up very well for the gameplay. There is a large amount of detail in every area, dense forests, murky swamps, haunting churches, and no part of it seems out of place. There are a large amount of graphical options to tune the game to your liking and to improve your performance, and they are still working on implementing even more. The game\u2019s performance is not great yet, even on a very powerful machine, but they are constantly making adjustments with every patch. One other important thing to note, is the game still does not have a field of view setting, which will certainly turn off a lot of people who would prefer to play on a higher setting. Amongst all of the many things I love about the game, I honestly believe the audio may be my favorite part. It may seem like a strange thing to say about a videogame, but the audio truly is what ties the entire experience together. Crytek have tried very hard to make sure every aspect of the game keeps you on your toes, feeling the tension of the area around you, always forcing you to be as aware as possible. Every patch that comes to the game improves aspects of the audio as it\u2019s not all perfect yet, but overall it absolutely is the most important thing driving the immersion of this game. The audio is also constantly relevant to gameplay, players can give away their position by crunching on branches or broken glass, gunshots can be heard from across the map if you\u2019re not careful about what weapon you\u2019re using. As the game advances they are also adding more ways to use the audio to play mind games on your opponents such as throwable decoys that imitate a gunshot sound where they land. I believe the audio will always be one of the most important aspects of the game and something that will continue being a driving force for the tension and ambiance. Hunt: Showdown is one of the most unique first person shooter games on the market. Due to its hardcore nature and it not being finished it has yet to find a massive playerbase. However it provides something that almost no other games do, an incredibly immersive player vs. player experience that continues to be thrilling and tense even after having played it for hundreds of hours. Crytek have done a very good job improving the game thus far, and I am certain that when they believe the game is finished, it will be one of the best first person shooters ever made.",

                "text": "Hunt Showdown  was one of my favorite games, a intensehardcore shooter with top notch atmosphere and gunplay, sadly in thehands of incompetent devs who take the game in the wrong direction.The last patch 1.4.8 (12.12.20) bring problems for many people,fps drops and weird stuttering while fps/ping is stable.Hunt was never known as a well optmized game or for its great servers,but at this point its nearly unplayble for me.Hunt Showdown shows a long history of patches that need mostly morethan one hotfix to run well, with this knowledge they pushed 1.4.8 on the live server and escaped into xmas holidays, well done crytek...It seems the devs don\u00b4t care much they just stay silent for weeks insteadof rollback the patch and/or working on the problem. Sure, to be fair, meanwhilethey announced that one of their loved overpriced DLC\u00b4s is now on sale, nice !This is just one of many examples how the devs deal with problems and treat their playerbase. Also important to mention how they rushed a fake 1.0 (21.08.19)release and then continue changing core gameplay elements of the gameor big design/meta changes. At the actual situation of the game it is still in an stateas a early access game, playable, but far away from a finished product.Its not only that they try desperately to reach more player by making the game more and more casual, no. They also offer one of the worse community work and technical support.Crytek act like a little indie dev team here, i see no hope that they will make it.They just can\u00b4t, acting helpless, unable to fix the netcode and bugs which exitssince the early alpha.Beside all the negative aspects its still a unique game and can bring some very intense and funny moments, if you are lucky that the servers running well...But i guess at some point they will just shut down the server and moveon to another project what maybe offer better monetization. Crytek proof thisby showing more interest into selling DLC\u00b4s rather than looking into technical issues.A game like a rough diamond, sadly processed with a jackhammer.",

There are other humans or more precicly other Hunters who will try to take the bounty away from you...wich means.....well they most probably will try to kill you during so.I always had a dream, to once meet people there that wont shoot but rather talk with me and even be friends with me. At some point I gave up looking for them. Today 26.01.2020 I found a 3 man group in Hunt.At first they tried to kill me, cornered me......but they didnt do it.I started speaking to them: \"Hey you guys, i`ve got an Idea. How about you take one bounty and leave so nobody gets hurt.\" Silence......but then.......He answerd: \" sure, but how can I trust you?\"I repled: \"You can`t\".......The conversation goes on about trust issues and stuff but in the end one of them decided to come near with no weapon. He said that they are trusting me so they only send one unarmed person. I showed him the Bounty and he took it. I was...........very supriced .......noone ever was friendly to me.........He asked me where he could safely leave me again. (we were in a cave just so you know)I showed him the exit. As he saw the exit he looked at me and said: \"Thanks\" my heart was pounding. I didnt know if he would \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 me over or just leave after all. I was happy and kinda sad. As he turned and took his first step towards the exit..........I shot him in the head. I killed him.I have no excuses.Hunt Showdown is a cruel place....",

                "text": "I've been following Hunt since the game was first annouced, but only recently decided to take the plunge. A fairly small community and unforgiving gameplay being my priamry reasons for holding back as long as I did.I can safely say my doubts were proven wrong, when I watched the latest content update reveal and saw the developers were really passionate about supporting the future of the game. Gameplay wise, Hunt is one of a kind. It's unforgiving but at the same time incredibly addictive. A combination I haven't seen this successfull in any other competitive multiplayer games. The game mechanics make the world feel alive and the interaction between other players intense and exciting. AI controlled enemies only further add to the intensity of the gameplay and provide more ways of interacting with the world.Speaking of the \"world\", the graphics are absolutely gorgeous. People have complained about performance issues but personally I've had very few. It really is very polished when compared to most early access games. The atmosphere is amazing and the amount of detail across the environments is evident everywhere you go. Both interior and exterior locations have received a lot of effort to make them feel real. The enemies look and sound scary and really belong in the horrific setting of the 1895 Louisiana wilderness. The gunplay is another amazing aspect of Hunt. Weapons are fun to shoot and firefights are intense if not brief. The more you play, the more you unlock and consequently the more risk you take when you play a match. If you die, you lose everything you're carrying, except for xp and cash earned. This is the trade off for bringing more powerful weapons into the match and is a great way of balancing higher level players against newer ones.I could go into so much more about Hunt but I think you really need to play it to understand how enjoyable it is. I'm not usually someone who likes battle royale type games or perma death, but Hunt is something new altogether. Give it a try if you have any interest, it won't disappoint you!",

                "text": "I'll be making this as informative as possible for any potential buyers out there, so please bear with me. This game is regarded as a hardcore, niche shooter that began as a PVE (Player versus Environment) title that was converted to PVP (Player versus Player) with PVE elements as the Battle Royal fad picked up steam. *My suggestion at the start is; don't buy it yet, but keep an eye on it.* The ultimate purpose of each match is to locate clues to triangulate a npc boss placed randomly around the map, kill it, banish it to hell, then grab a bounty token as proof of the kill and finally extract to three randomly generated locations on the outskirts of the map. As you attempt to fulfill this task, you'll likely engage some NPC enemies as they've heavily populated the map and have converged on various settlements. Not only that, but you're running the risk of engaging with other players, and then killing them.  The AI enemies exist to redirect players, force them to give away their position by combat, serve as an unconventional warning system to nearby players and lastly to complicate existing shootouts between players. Mind you, they are actually deadly and can easily kill you if you're caught in a pinch. Fortunately for you lot, they're stupid. First things first, no weapon in this game operates on a hitscan mechanic but on an actual projectile system. Hitscan mechanics are very popular among shooters, as you only need to place your crosshairs on a target and pull the trigger to deal damage. Hunt's true projectile system requires you to know the speed of your ammunition type and to lead your shots appropriately to fight effectively. Hunt places an incredible amount of emphasis on sound, as players make noises no AI can replicate and are the only things capable of triggering sound traps. It could be argued that you'll hear your opponents before you see them, so ambushes are highly likely. Your goal is to get the bounty, but killing players often takes precedent.Regarding soundtraps, they're everywhere. Gatherings of crows and ducks which get spooked if a player gets too close, to dying horses and caged animals which break out into a frenzy should you approach. Shards of glass scattered on the ground, hanging kitchenware, bottles, horseshoes and chains. The cries of the AI enemies if they detect a player. The sounds of players grunting as they fight the AI. Simply moving around makes noise depending on the surface upon which you travel: dry dirt, mud, wooden planks, fallen branches, metal roofs and water. Gunshots will ring out from incredible distances, with certain guns being more noticeable.There are five projectile speeds in the game, technically six. Starting from slowest to fastest, we have: Thrown items, Crossbow bolts, Compact, Shotshells, Medium and Long. It could be argued that thrown items don't count, but I've placed them here for informative purposes.  Learning the relative speeds of your ammuntion type and the weapons that utilize them is the foundation for combat. Generally speaking, you'll start the game with weapons using shotgun shells and compact ammo. Crossbow bolts and medium ammo using weapons are unlocked rather mid to late bloodline, whereas long ammo weapons are mostly late bloodline options.The Bloodline is one of two leveling mechanics Hunt features. It is your direct account level, and governs the unlocking of weapons, traits, cash prizes and hunter tiers. Hunter tiers used to provide substantial benefits, a Tier 3 hunter would have 150 health compared to a Tier 1 possessing 100. This was removed a while ago, so now higher Tier hunters only bring cosmetic changes and potentially better equipment and traits when you hire them. The second leveling mechanic is the hunters themselves. If you successfully extract from a mission alive, your hunter is rewarded experience based on what you did in the mission and levels up. Leveling your hunter gives you more perk points, which are used to purchase traits for your hunter. Your bloodline simply unlocks the trait, but you must level your hunter and then purchase the trait. This is locked to the hunter himself, and if he dies they're gone forever. You'll need to level another hunter in order to purchase the trait again, or get lucky in the recruitment phase and hire a hunter already featuring the trait. This mechanic empowers those who survive, making them more resilient to the environment or more deadly outright with the proper traits.-With the implementation of the quickplay mode, players have the opportunity to play at no risk in an actual battle royal. You rush to find 4 items of interest, and then if you're the first to get 4 your goal is to survive. The longer you're alive the more money you'll walk away with, even if you die. If someone beats you to the punch, you'll need to kill them and take the objective for yourself. This mode allows low leveled players to potentially get and use endgame weapons and traits. However, you can take these weapons into the original mode only if you win the quickplay mission. This means that skilled players can easily get strong loadouts for free, with the added benefit of the contraband status on your equipment. With quickplay, money is no consequence, since playing the mode exclusively results in free money and bloodline experience; with the added benefit of a No Risk High Reward loadout should you win. I'll wrap things up here with what I feel is the outright cons. -The game is incredibly unforgiving to new players. Combat against players is very different than against AI, therefore trial and error is the name of the early game. Doesn't help that low rank gear and equipment is laughable in comparison to everything else.-An actual practice range isn't in the game, it's on the roadmap for the future but that means you're on your own. Basically it means that you'll learn to swim by jumping off a boat.  -A while back compact ammunition provided low rank players with the potential to kill higher ranked players with a headshot at long range. High rank players complained to the point where the devs nerfed the ammo type to prevent long range sniping, meaning that high rank hunters can one tap you from a distance in which you'll need to hit them twice. This was regarded as a nerf to skill, by some players.-The community is rather hostile to new people on the steam discussion forums. This is a niche, hardcore shooting game. Any suggestions to make things easier for newer players or to make the game more appealing to a wider audience usually gets shot down quickly. -Unoptimized game across many different rigs.-Suffers from low player count, you're often put into empty games or repeatedly matched with the same/higher ranked players.-Quickplay provides a zero risk way to quickly get money and Bloodline ranks, compared to the main Bounty Hunt mode.-Matchmaking is based on two key points, Hunter Kills/Deaths and Bounties extracted. If you play a bunch of empty games and extract several bounties you'll likely be matched with players with large amounts of kills. Bounties being extracted equals a material advantage.-Existing playerbase is divided by 7 regions, then 2 game modes, and lastly 3 different bounties on the base game mode, Bounty Hunt.-Currently there isn't much of a temptation to prestige in this game outside of personal challenge and promises of unspecified future rewards. The result is players reaching rank 100 and just sitting there forever, at rank 100 you gain a constant cash flow and retain access to all items. -There's rumbling in the distance in regards to the Dev's stability; they're apparently shifting from adding new content to optimization for several months out. In conclusion I stress the following: Don't buy it yet, but keep an eye on it.EDIT: They're bringing in premium currency and microtransactions. It looks like it'll be cosmetic for now, but we all know how slippery a slope that is huh?",

                "text": "The update is amazing,I love the new map and the way the world opens up. The world feels bigger and more immersive and the combat has a more chaotic feel to it witch is nice so many angles and ways to play at almost every part of the map I have seen so far. I like the hills and rocks and I appreciate that they made them more stable and easy to climb. I feel like i am smaller in this world and there are so many places and angles enemies can be . This update is amazing and if the devs keep doing things like this this, this game could really be one of the number one sellers on steam. I still would like to see easier character building via load outs or a drag and drop menu. I feel like the time between games could make this a more action packed twitch streaming kinda game if we did not have to double click and find all of our load out items and could get back into the hunt faster. But this update is well worth a purchase for this game you wont be disappointed.    I would 100% recommend  this game and say its one of the best multiplayer games i have played in a long time. However the amount of hackers and lack of dev response to them is just overwhelming. I know you will see a bunch of hackers saying in comments i rarely see hacking but with the amount of time i have played, let me tell you its the number one problem. You will notice allot of Chinese and German players on the american servers . one of the Chinese guys I played with spoke english I asked him why he doesn't play in the asian servers where there is less lag for him. He told me the hacking is so bad that every game has at least one and most of the time its just teams of hackers fighting each other. He tole me its so bad the hackers are mad at other hackers killing them and pouring into the us server so they can hack against non hackers.  I am assuming its the same in the german  server. In US its not that bad but still very bad. Look on youtube and you will see people displaying their hacks for sale and others showing hackers obviously cheating. I have had people call my name out tell me they can see me and kill me thru walls so many times I can't count. Look on the leader boards and you will see an unbelievable amount of people with 8K more kills than deaths and tho there are some players that are that good the number of them on this game will show you how bad this is. The devs solution? change the leader boards and how they display not ban the hackers. The reporting system has no feedback you can click report on a name as many times as you want it doesn't say received or were looking into it nothing. It makes you feel like its that suggestion box that goes directly into the furnace . At the very least just take the people who are reported multiple times in multiple matches and either review them or put them all in the same server where the non hacking players can have fun and enjoy this amazing game. Please do something anything to make your game not die. The sad thing is I want this game to survive and thrive it seems like more than the devs do with their lack of response to this overwhelming problem. Use a better anti cheat have admins play and see what I do.",

                "text": "is a hardcore, Multiplayer FPS PvEvP game with amazing audio, a rather unique setting, and hands-down, the most infuriating gunplay I\u2019ve ever had the opportunity to try. How come I\u2019m recommending it? Well, you\u2019ll have to read the rest of the review to find that out.::So, I\u2019ve played Hunt for 191 hours at the time of writing this review. I\u2019ve had the privilege of having many of my friends interested in this game so I always had a party to play with. It\u2019s been a great time and frustration all in one package but, .HUNT: Showdown is a pretty straightforward game. Collect the clues, slay the monster and, extract to cash-in their bounty. The problem is, extracting alive with the bounty is not going to be easy as there will be up to 11 other players and they\u2019re all hell-bent on doing the exact same thing.The best thing about this is actually the lack of information about other hunters. You will never know if you\u2019re alone in a server or how many hunters are there. The game will never tell you if another hunter died, has another teammate or if they\u2019ve left the game. The only way you can make sure that someone is dead is if you personally kill them.More often than not, you\u2019ll have to force your way out of the zone and battle multiple enemies to cash-in your bloody prize. On the other hand, if you\u2019re the one who\u2019s stalking other players, clever use of stealth, the game\u2019s amazing audio design, positioning, and your tools will help you take your target(s) down and claim the bounty for yourself. That\u2019s why it is generally a good idea not to be stingy when it comes to your hunter's equipment and loadout, before accepting a contract.Make sure you can take the hit and live through so,  as they\u2019re the best way to quickly deal with the monsters without alerting other hunters to your presence.You could also bring dynamite sticks and bundles, Molotov cocktails or frag grenades. There are various trip-mines, barb-wire spools, vials of poisonous gas, and  jars with venomous insects. What you bring is completely up to you, but keep one thing in mind - .Your hunter, his guns, tools, and consumable items \u2013 they'll be lost forever. You won\u2019t get the money back, and you don't get the opportunity to retrieve them. Starting all over again is the only option.Hunt: Showdown's gunplay feels uninspiring, and somewhat inconsistent at times.  of Hunt: Showdown.Pretty much all of the game\u2019s rifles are little more than copy-pastes of another. Sure, they have slightly different statistics like effective range and damage values, but most rifles rifle and handguns in this game feels very similar.On top of that, weapon stats are kind of arbitrary.A point blank shotgun blast will occasionally forget to kill the target, while shots from far away can do wonders.All of the rifles need precisely two body-shots to get a hunter to 0 HP which means that, no matter what rifle you pick, you will need the exact number of bullets to kill a hunter. It also means that every hunter with a single-shot weapon is likely to follow the exact same playstyle: tag the target once with a rifle from a distance, and then close in to finish them off with a pistol.Hunt also has several rather interesting weapons. Namely, those are crossbows and, unsurprisingly, they\u2019re my weapon of choice. They\u2019re hard to master but if you manage to do it, you\u2019ll get to wield a frightening weapon and become a deadly, silent stalker.An upper body show with a crossbow will take down any player from up to 47 meters. Sure, you have to consider the bolt\u2019s trajectory, the movement of the player, compensate for the projectile\u2019s arc, and keep in mind that it won\u2019t pierce any surface, but should you hit them, they're either dead or bleeding heavily.There are also variations of the crossbow. One launches explosive bolts that detonate on impact, the other packs a shotgun shell which will trigger after landing a hit, dealing both the bolt and the slug damage and lastly, the not so useful poison crossbow - the less said about this one, the better.Then there are weapons like the , a pistol with a shotgun shell at its core, perfect for close-quarter encounters or when an enemy manages to corner you. Guns like  rifle which is a hybrid of a sniper and a shotgun, more experimental weapons like the ridiculous  or the Mosin-Nagant Avtomat...An if that\u2019s not enough for you, . Almost every weapon has its shortened version meaning that you\u2019ll sacrifice power but it will take less space in your inventory.Some have custom reloading mechanisms , others come with melee weapons attached to them. If you can\u2019t aim with those terrible iron-sights, pick a dead-eye or marksman variant of your favorite weapon and add some proper optics. The options are numerous.What really sticks out like a sore thumb is the game\u2019s performance. With a whole generation of stronger-than-required hardware, I\u2019m struggling to maintain a satisfying framerate in this game without even maxing its graphical settings. And I\u2019m not the only one.Although very rarely, the game will sometimes simply choose not to work. Objects will appear as muddy blocks, placeholders, or fail to load entirely making it impossible to navigate as I keep bumping into the trees, mud hills, random objects, and partially rendered, t-posing monsters.Another minus to the game, even though I appreciate the vagueness when it comes to certain aspects, the game really should improve on team communication. Mainly, the ping system. It\u2019s just bad and needs improvement.Last but not least \u2013 the microtransactions.It\u2019s not like you\u2019re forced to get them but the game is obviously made with some of them in mind. Acquisition of legendary items and hunters (basically skins) and additional hunter slots is incredibly slow and I\u2019m pretty sure the microtransactions are to blame. It\u2019s a AA, premium price game with a bunch of paid DLC to it.To be fair, the game does allow for Blood Bounds (the premium resource) to be farmed but the process is incredibly slow.Are youre hardcore macho who values challenge? If you\u2019re not afraid to lose everything and can withold yourself from smashing through your monitor with your macho fists when a game pulls a cheap one at you, consider giving it a try. It may not be perfect but it might be what you're looking for.",

Normally it's either solo players or duos.Everyone spawns at certain points at the edge of the map and tries to use their special power \"Dark Sight\" to search for clues on the location of these PVE objectives. At the moment of writing this, there are 3 bosses:The Butcher, the Spider and the AssassinIt takes 3 clues per boss to pinpoint his location (unless you just so happen to be strolling into the boss' building by chance).Your job is: Pick a hunter, buy equipment (both hunter and equipment are lost on death) and try to be sneaky enough to not get murdered from behind by a fellow player. At the same time making sure you are well-enough equipped to take care of whatever boss the game decides to throw at you.If you happen to be the first team at the boss or everyone else has left the playing field one way or another, you can kill the boss and pick up its bounty. Now your final job is extracting that bounty and bringing it home safely. Because here is the catch:As soon as you start banishing the boss after killing it (takes roughly 2 minutes), every other player will know your location, whether they picked up the 3 hints or not. And if you're unlucky, everyone wants a piece of your kill. Since every boss only drops 2 bounties, there are often firefights during banishing where one team tries to remove the competition and it developing into a 2 v 2 v 2 stand-off.But wait.. there's more.. should you manage to defend your kill, picking up the bounty will make you permanently visible on the map for all other players. So now you get to run to an exit with everyone knowing your exact location.Long story short: Hunt is an adrenaline-inducing adventure, sometimes frustrating, sometimes breath-taking. You want to bring your best hunter and guns to make the job easy, but should you get unlucky, that hunter and that gear is permanently lost, leaving you to start from zero with a different hunter anew.There are many moments where you sit in cover, holding your breath, hoping to not get noticed. Others where you are desperate to try and get your character out of a difficult situation by running for your life.It is a challenge, I won't deny that. It definitely isn't for everyone. This is not like other mainstream shooters where you get to respawn and find your killer. If your team is wiped, so is everything you have worked for with that one character.In terms of enjoyment and entertainment I give this game an 8.5/10One thing I should add: This game chugs performance like a mofo. A middle-class or higher gaming PC is advised.Edit:I love this game, but one thing that keeps annoying me: This is now the 3rd 30+ hunter that I lost to server errors. If your game crashes, you get your hunter back. If the server \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 up, you lose everything.",

In Hunt, your objective is much more straightforward.-Gunfight are sometimes very ingaging and long to the point of a War of Attrition and Wit, somethig very unique to Hunt's Setting and Weapons-Overall very good and fun game: 9/10 would debate Hunt superiority again",

To me, at least. I encounter a fair amount of players that play at full speed at all times, and that's fine too.The prevalence of bolt action and lever action rifles, breech loading shotguns, and revolvers make this feel very different from most shooters. To me, it is a welcome change. I have had more fun with this shooter than I have with any other in quite some time. While definitely not for everyone, if the idea of stalking/hunting a AI boss, while simultaneously hunting other players and having to stay alert for players that are coming for you, sounds like a good time, give it a shot.",

This is the most original and unique game I have played in a long time.I've been hooked on PUBG for the last year or so but this game has ripped my attention away from it completely. There is an awesome combination of gunplay and strategy when dealing with other players. And killing zombies and bosses along the way is equally as pleasing. Killing other hunters is this game in EXTREMELY satisfying. Killing and dying hold a lot of importance in this game, as there are only 10 players in each match. Playing this game with your friend is a blast. 10/10 recommend. This is the first review I've ever written by the way, because this game is that awesome.- It is early access so I won't even put the matchmaking/load times in my review because that isn't the game itself...

                "text": "Hunt Showdown has been the best experience I've had with a shooter so far.The game is a pvp & pve stealth game, but it can also be played more fast pace, though the game is designed to be played slower and with a more careful approach, since every small decision or mistake can lead to you being discovered or possibly killed.PROS:+The gunplay is a lot of fun and makes perfect sense for this type of game.The guns feel like they got weight to them, kind of clunky but true to the era.The clunkiness of the weapons also impacts your playstyle and when you decide to shoot, because every shot counts, due to the scarcity of ammo and other ressources and because you might be discovered by other players in your area.+The game design and setting is beautiful, dark and unique.This western setting with monsters and grim lore makes for a perfect pvp survival shooter experience.The map design is smart and beautiful. Every location looks different and has many obstacles and covers where you can hide behind during gunfights. Due to this no gunfight feels the same.+The sounddesign is unlike any other multiplayer shooter game's.You can perfectly estimate distances and directions of shots or footsteps of other players.Every enemy-type makes different sounds when being aggroed, attacked or killed, so if you alert an enemy, other players in the area will surely know.+The Mobs actually pose a threat.Mobs are usually oneshot-kills, except for the bosses, but if you are being attacked by other players in addition to the mobs, you are almost sure to killed. +The perk system is balanced.You can have a maxed out hunter and still be killed by level one hunters who have no perks.The perks are great and make certain things easier for the build you're going for, but they don't make you overpowered.+Recruiting and equiping hunters with weapons and items makes for a fun survival experience.Once your hunter dies on a mission you lose every progress you made with him, which makes the decisions you make feel like they have an impact, and usually you don't just rush enemies, because unlike other shooters you don't respawn instantly after being killed. You have to recruit and equip a new hunter before being able to go on another mission.CONS:-Sometimes mobs just spawn right in front of you, or further away.This takes you out of the experience or could potentially even spook you.-Sometimes the outline of objects don't work.For example, sometimes you will be shooting between two treebranches and the bullet will impact in the air between the two branches because the outline is sometimes not precise, which can be very frustrating when you're engaged in a firefight.-It's hard to recommend the game to friends because the learning curve is incredibly long.I've played the game for 300h  and i still feel like i'm making rookie mistakes.Which is both challenging and annoying at times.CONCLUSION:I can really recommend this game to anyone who likes survival shooters and stealth oriented games.The game is very immersive and dark which no game has pulled off as well as Hunt Showdown, especially since it's a multiplayer game.For anyone looking for a challenging pvp & pve game, this is your game.",

I primarily farm PvE and only occasionally seek out PvP (though it finds me plenty). I've even managed to take out a couple of two-hunter teams. I'm sure others are like \"\" but for me that was quite difficult and made for very proud moments. The PvE is fun, and the PvP is also fun.The 1800s firearms are just super duper well done. Reloading animations take forever (as they should with these guns), in a far more realistic way than most FPS games. When I press the button to reload my revolver, the animation is: I hold the gun up, open the loading port, eject the spent casing, load in a fresh bullet, revolve the cylinder and repeat until fully loaded, close the loading port, spin the cylinder, and pull the hammer back. Firing and reloading are just , coming from the perspective that I love these old firearms and enjoy the immersion/realism that goes into their operation in the game. The guns and gun-play are the main things that draw me to the game. I'd love to see a single-player campaign for this, either as content for Showdown or as a separate stand-alone title. I'd play the ever-loving tar out of that too.The sound design in the game is absolutely . Hearing footsteps, broken glass being tread upon, chains rattling, doors opening, etc. all around you is very important. The directional audio is second to none and can help to keep you alive if you are paying attention. Gunshots can be heard from across the map, and each gun (or gun type at least) has it's own sound. You can tell what type of gun someone is using, and approximately how far away they are, and in which direction from the sound that is generated. The hunt is on, and I'm ready to die over and over again in my pursuit of these bounties. Cowboy up, and hunt down some undead.",

                "text": "EDIT 5: More frequent sales, some good events and big streamers playing the game helped it grow a bit. Average concurrent players went up to 9-10k, from 6k. Third map came out way later than it should, but still a great addition. The game is overall better than in 2019. Still recommended. Game is cool, but develops at snail speed.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TL;DR: The game is great, I love it, many love it, but the price tag is off-putting and it never gets popular and well-known. Pricey for a not popular game. It has issues just like any other games, but people play bugged games if they love it anyway. Slow development, updates take long time to come out. Low but decent 6k active playerbase (steamcharts). You can still have fun with it.Review at the time:Here are some thoughts I've already shared in the forums:-I'm a teacher and I have hundreds of teens per semester, NO STUDENT KNOWS ABOUT HUNT. Up to now, I haven't heard ''oh yeah, I know Hunt\" as a response to \"do you know Hunt: Showdown?\" And FPS culture and FPS competitive scene is very strong here in my country (Brazil). -About bugs... a real example: Dead by Daylight has many bugs and issues, delays fixes and quality of life changes, only now will have servers... and people play it. The game costs BRL18 on sales, which are frequent, while Hunt costs BRL90. Both are niche games. Both are innovative. Both have issues. Dead by Daylight capitalizes on skins. People who love your game will buy skins, just like Fortnite, Dota, LoL, and whatever. One good skin in Dead by Daylight costs BRL21, more than the game on sale... On the other hand, Hunt pushes the base price too hard. The price is absurd compared to its popularity, reviews and number of active players. - People need a decent rig to play Hunt, plus a decent account balance to afford it. Not many people will drop BRL90 for a game they haven't ever heard about. EA games are expensive and people buy them because they already have a solid fame and etc, even though they are bugged. People play your bugged game if they love it. But to love it, they must know it first, it's so simple. The Sims DLCs cost more than the base game... All of its DLCs are certainly more than BRL2.000. A nobody like Hunt: Showdown should release at a lower price to attract people. Then after players have put some hours into the game, they WILL be willing to support it and buy the skins and DLC they wish for.-Peak players is higher during Free Weekend than during Lauch, which means the number of people who 'want to play' the game is bigger than the number of people who 'had abandoned' the game. Matches are not always full.-People comment about free games: \"It's simple, not a lot of content, but hey, it's free\". So yeah, people firstly think about the base price before criticizing anything.-PS.: Graphics are wonderful, impressive job, I don't know why and how can people complain, calling it ugly.Summary: good game, needed more players, but too expensive to attract a bigger number of active players. If more people are trying your game, there will be more people playing and supporting your game.Edit 1: They are trying to lower price now, but game has lost the launch momentum. What a wasted opportunity. Plus are there any ads? We never see the game being advertised. Few new players coming in. It gets a bit tiring to try to be part of it, when it's only going down. Still keeping a thumbs up because of the ''what a phenomenal gaming experience'' moments this game provides.Edit 2: Updates hated by that selective playerbase. By the time I reviewed, it was positive, that's why I'm keeping it that way. But the game WAS a lot of fun, but kept going downhill. What a short lifespan there. That's so sad. RIP.Edit 3: 1 year after 1.0, they put it on 45% sale and launched Twitch Drops. Active players went up a bit by now. But let's see. They took too long to start doing something about price and merchandising.Edit 4: The playerbase somehow kept steady, and the average 6k active players monthly is still there (steamcharts). You can find matches to play, this is enough. BUT game's popularity is still low, not really a well-known game, and it's out for some years, that's disappointing.",

                "text": "Hunt Showdown - was once an awesome and fun game. For the most part, it still is. I really don't want to give this game a thumbs up in its current state, but in saying that, I don't want to give it a thumbs down either. Its a \"Love/Hate\" relationship. The actual game play is fun as hell most of the time, but with declining players, it becomes stale and boring. The game isn't stable for many players, and the glitches are mounting up. So the ONLY reason I am giving this game a thumbs up is because it has provided me with a lot of fun and joy and I most certainly got my moneys worth. And I do sincerely hope that this game will continue to grow and be great someday. But it does need a LOT of work. A LOT. And of course, it needs more players. The game is definitely very unique. Its one of the best PvP/PvE games I have played in a very long time. They have this awesome idea and style. They just need to focus, fix the issues, add more content. Perhaps even have a DOUBLE XP weekend from time to time to help draw players back. Many games do this. And they need to do some proper marketing. I guess Pros & Cons can be listed below.Pros- Improved performance (however I just recently got a new PC so that could be that reason for this).- Game is fun to play, and anything can happen in any match.- Legendary Hunters/Legendary Weapons are fun to work toward owning them some day.- Female Hunters - however they need to work on a balance because it seems like there are more females than males to choose from. Perhaps adding a \"Gender Preference\" so that when you shuffle them for hire, you get more of what you want.- Money is easy enough to make- Choice to choose a money bonus or XP boost each time you prestige- Blood Bonds. Gives you something to work toward.- Bosses are more difficult which is good.- Changes in the compound. More ways to approach a compound, more entry points, more ladders etc. - Timer increased to 30 seconds from 20 seconds. It adds tension and can lead to a possible shootout. Bad side though, have seen more extraction point campers since this update.Cons- Trio matches. I do find the option good, however, I find that it splits the player base. Most people who solo or duo will likely have the Trio selection set to \"OFF\" so without a big player base, you will find more servers empty. For both the Trio groups and for ones that solo or play in Duo. - No Custom Lobby and to learn that Crytek don't see this as a priority. Come on, it would be awesome fun to play with friends. One vs One or as a team against your own friends. Give us the custom lobby. Its one of the main things the community looked forward to.- Graphics downgrade and thinning of the trees etc. The graphics is nothing to what it was back when it was in Early Access. As time went by, they thinned the trees to a point that you could see from one compound right into another. Outside of Slaughterhouse was filled with bushes, so you could ambush players or even hide from them if you didn't feel confident enough to take them on for what ever reason. But all that is gone now. - Only has two maps. And its becoming very stale seeing the same scenery. Crytek need to think about bringing more maps out to keep the game interesting. Playing the same maps over and over, people learn every crack in a wall. - clues need to be more randomised.- Adding the red glow and humming to clues killed the immersion too. It was meant to stop people from clue camping but it did the opposite. And half the fun was also to go to a clue without knowing someone can be around. But now? The red glow or humming alerts you right away. That just kills the fun. Even if you wanted to follow the enemy and strike an ambush, that gets tossed out the window due to this retarded mechanism. REMOVE it for pete's sake!- Prestiging feels less rewarding and feels more like a punishment. Due to the new weapons  & consumable/tools unlock system, it just feels more tedious than it really has to be. Why force players into using items just to unlock the one they really want? Why should i spend money and throw little dynamite sticks if i ever want to unlock a big bundle? Why should i be forced to use a certain base weapon if i want to some day unlock the better varient? It worked fine the way it was before. You unlock it once you reach the appropriate level. So if I want to use Mosin Nagant Bayonet I need to get XP with the non Bayonet version first. Etc. If i want to use Concertina, I have to unlock multiple different things before i can use it. Before full release, it was made available at level 30. It seems like such an extra grind. And when you can prestige relatively quickly, all this unlocking seems pointless and a waste of time. - DLCs are now sold seperately and not as a bundle. And the legendary hunter, particularly the Phantom has some serious clipping issues. - Server instability and Mission Bag Summary that seem to reoccur frequently, where you receive no XP, no Money, no kills. Nothing. But if you die, that still counts. So that can totally wreck with your K:D- Empty servers because the player base is dropping so rapidly - Changes to the male sound files. They were fine the way they were. We want our unigue original Male death screams back.- female voices sound like porn stars when they're injured. Rethink these and maybe change them to sound like they're more in pain than in ecstacy. Just saying.- More Boss additions. - Monster Book / Weapon book seems to glitch. I think it needs to be re-looked at.- Player footsteps are way over loud and drowns out just about every other sound.- Adding heaving breathing sounds to your player when they point a gun wasn't the best idea. Now you can hear enemies way too easy. Even their sneaking sounds are over amplified that i can hear them down the opposite end of the hall. Was this intentional? The overall sounds in this game don't seem to be working too well in general. Some sounds are also cut out entirely. For example. Partner hears gunfire in the distance. For me, I heard nothing. If i creep closer to where my partner was and they fire shots again, THIS time I heard it. I am sure there are others to add, but i will leave it here. I really wanted to give this game in its current state a THUMBS down. But I will give it a Thumbs Up because it is overall, despite all its short comings, a fun game to play.EDIT: After 3 years... the server issues are still a huge problem. Seriously getting fed up when you play a decent match ONLY for the game to freeze and close off with the \"Send Error Report\" and its happening to other people. How about you fix this issue because seriously, I am getting ticked off with the amount of hunters I have lost due to server issues, among OTHER mounting glitches. And not to mention, 3+ years and still waiting for another map. Finally have another boss, and that's all sweet and dandy, but come on Crytek. MORE maps and how about those custom servers you promised us for years. Why is this put aside for the 2nd or 3rd time now.PS: And maybe look into your so-called anti-cheat while you're at it because I have come across an increase number of VERY suspicious players and its beginning to be very off-putting and the lack of interest from this company is beginning to disgust me.UPDATED: Finally have a third map and its a real fun one. A thumbs up from me for this one.",

                "text": "You're running the gauntlet, gleefully leaving a macabre series of killings behind; you have two partners watching your back, after all. Once the dust settles, the seemingly empty marshland grows ominously silent, and... BANG! The piercing whistle of bullets shrill through your mates' skulls. Both are taking a dirt nap as you wade through the knee-deep swamp water now with only a quarter of your hard-earned bounty, holding on to your dear, almost empty health bar. Facing the same fate as your crew, all that terror you went through, now a fading memory. Very soon you will be too.You'll die, paying the price for shattering the peace in the bayou. You don't win. Best-case scenario, you live to die another day.Blending the competitive forays of Battle Royales with horror-themed cooperative bounty hunting,  comes out on top as the prime example of an engrossing multiplayer experience. It requires your utmost attention. Analyze closely and always think a few steps ahead, as if you're playing chess against a grandmaster. You might have your moments, but doing so is no easy feat.You, a patron to a \"Bloodline\" of voodoo bounty hunters, have been summoned to the plagued swamps of Louisiana in the late 19th century. Using the Dark Sight to search for clues around three generously-sized maps, your task is to banish the nastiest of those creatures back to hell and escape with bounties in hand. From garden-variety zombies to demonic mutants, all manners of menacing beasts are found along the way. Be it old hags spewing out swarms of poisonous bees from their chest, or charred immolators bursting out in flames if their skin is pierced.But, none are the stout challenge you'd be looking for. Not even the bosses. An elusive assassin, a nimble wall-crawling spider, and a bulky butcher with a flaming hook, all three seem to be formidable opponents, though, against seasoned huntsmen, they don\u2019t require much strategic thinking to take down. Frankly, every hunter of the bayou regards these targets as tertiary, their heads will not make for proud cabin trophies.That bounty you happily took after killing the boss is the start of pure bloodlust. It's a \"put a bullet in me\" beacon, visible on the map, while also boosting your magic with a wallhack of some sort for mere seconds. As up to eleven other sweaty, try-hard hunters are racing to your location, it's up to you whether to put up a fight or madly dash through the muck to an extraction point.It feels like an insoluble dilemma, given that death lurks about these festering lands. If your hunters go down, after the initial grace period, they\u2019re taking all of their equipment and upgrades with them. While frustrating at first, the immense tension a permanent death causes, however punishing, keeps you on your toes at all times. The fear of losing hours of work in the blink of an eye makes the competitive, if mostly sluggish, nature of the encounters all the more thrilling.Money is found sparsely throughout the world, while hefty sums are given at the end of each session, which is used for recruiting hunters and gearing them up. XP on the other hand, varying on the number of killed baddies and extracted bounties, converts to upgrade points and contributes to the overall Bloodline ranks\u2014a natural progression system to simply show what item unlocks next.You may think once tapped out, you'll be hitting a wall. But no. You can always fall back on a gratis, low-tier hunter. Or perhaps, take your chances in the Quickplay, a free-for-all, last-man-standing take on the bounty hunting mode. Your starting options are narrowed to random weapons, but powerful ones are dotted around the map for the taking. Survive the ordeal, and you have a custom-made cowboy with choice gear and abilities that free ones don't come with.Naturally, the guns of the era are slow to shoot and painful to reload. Having an itchy trigger finger is a sure way to kiss the dust. From puny six-shooters to shotguns and big-bore rifles, with several interesting ammo types per each, all are nonetheless capable of dropping enemies with a shot to the head or upper torso\u2014unlike a good number of frivolous shooters. With that, anything is a death-blower in the right hands, turning each gunfight into one hell of a methodical showdown. A few widely accessible spam guns on the offer may be detrimental to the gameplay, but overall, the balancing is spot-on.However, should you see firearms as the weapon of last resort, your chances of survival will increase fourfold. The pitch-perfect binaural audio design urges you to stay as quiet as possible. Shot a gun? Somebody across the map heard it and can tell what gun you're using. Creeping up on foes caught up in a boss fight? Footsteps, even when crouched, are noticeable and distinguishably varied over different types of ground. Ears pricked for the proximity chat,  gets even more unnerving when other hunters acknowledge your presence. You turn back... but get a flying sledgehammer in the face.Seeing that you'll be spending most of your time sneaking around, understanding how and when to use the tools and traps is of the essence. Yeah, a big bundle of dynamite is scary, but is it scarier than getting flushed out with its decoy just to have your face blasted off with an exploding crossbow bolt? I didn't think so. Makeshift bombs give you an edge in the fights, while consumables ensure your longevity. Another asset to your advantage\u2014or disadvantage\u2014is the ambient alarm systems. Like a startled flock of crows that can easily give away the location of who jumped them. Or the grating noise of all creatures when agitated, from the undead to crippled horses and caged dogs. Most of my kills were obtained by carefully listening for clumsy movements.As you patiently traverse the fetid southern landscape, it's impossible to tear your gaze away from its grotesque beauty; atmospheric and vivid, with excellent lighting, you can almost feel the heat of the sun through the screen, yet a gritty feeling of despair clings to this zombie-infested old-west. That beauty puts a strain on the GPU as it does on the nerves. My  run the game in agony on a fluctuating 40-ish FPS with graphics set to the lowest. As the VRAM usage exceeds the limit, texture flickering becomes a deal-breaker, though that's a pain known only to low-end users.That said, there are a few technical drawbacks on the servers' side, too. While disconnections are few and far between, you can still lose your cherished cowboy when thrown out of the match. Compared to other games, desync and trading kills are taken to the extreme here. I have lost count on how many times I've shot a player down only to get killed by his dead self, lying cold on the ground, seconds later. It also makes navigating and climbing narrow spaces, namely ledges and stairs, a bit irritating as the subpar net coding often tries to correct my position between the client and the server.Ears ringing from all the gunshots, heart pounding out the chest, and hands trembling uncontrollably;  makes me feel alive and fight like there is no tomorrow. Unforgiving. Strenuous. Tense. An experience like no other. I think I need a smoke or three.",

                "text": "Hunt: Showdown is easily the best \"BR-like\" game there is at the moment. That is the simplest way to put it. Even if you heavily dislike BRs, which I do, Hunt may still be something that grabs your interest.Some standout points that make this game great:1. The Setting - With the aid of the CryEngine, the setting is the best realized and most cohesive setting out there. Set in 1895 in Louisiana, the game is dripping with atmosphere. Everything is appropriately dark and twisted looking to sell the horror and keeps you unsettled. The monsters are visually well designed and look great, the aesthetic of the hunters and their weapons is great, lots of classic \"cowboy\" weapons and then lots of fun, makeshift gadgets to help keep the game fresh.2. PvPvE - Every map is filled with zombies and other creatures, the ultimate goal is to find a boss monster spawned randomly on the map, kill it, and then take the \"tokens\" it leaves to an extraction and get out alive. Each individual hunter you bring into a mission has one life, die and you lose the equipment you brought and any perks the hunter may have earned in previous games. While this sounds very punishing, and it was early on in the game's life, the economy and rewards have been adjusted to account for this. One or two wins will often leave nearly halfway to max level for a hunter, similarly a single win can often earn you enough money to outfit your hunter with decent equipment for a couple of games. The lack of a mad scamble beginning where you are relying on RNG for good weapons makes the beginning of a match much more tense. That great loadout you brought is also at risk of being gone forever if you make a sloppy mistake and get mobbed by zombies or fall to an ambush from an enemy team.3. Small scale - Lots of people think \"OMG WE NEED 100 PLAYERS IN EVERY GAME\". Hunt completely goes against this and it's much to the game's benefit. 10 player max right now, though 1.0 release will raise this to 12 (and add the ability for teams of 3, right now it's duo or solo only). That's 5 teams for duos, this means that the reasonably sized map is not crawling with enemy players. THIS IS GOOD. It keeps the tension of \"there probably isn't anybody nearby, but there could be\". Due to this, and old time weapons that are slow to shoot and reload, Hunt has a very deliberate pacing with an almost stealth game feel to it. If you know there is a team in a compound and you can get into position without triggering any zombies, sound traps (birds, dying horses, kennels with dogs, chicken coops, broken glass, hanging chains, etc) you will be able to have a proper ambush and that advantage will help you win a lot more.Bounty Hunt is the main \"Hunt Experience\" with perma-death, hunting for your contract target which will be one of three \"boss\" monsters. A large spider (that actually acts like and moves around like a spider), a giant zombie with a severed pig's head that is an unstoppable behemoth, and the shadowy assassin that clones itself and dissolves into a swarm of insects as it moves around. Hunters are dead forever if you lose but the experience is incredibly rewarding when you fight your way through hordes of zombies, several enemy hunters, kill and banish the boss monster back to hell, and then escape at any extraction point on the map. If you are worried about perma-death being too punishing, Crytek has introduced a lot of new features to help even out the difficulty curve here. For example: If you like your current hunter a lot and have good weapons but are in a bad spot (perhaps you have no HP left or are just not confident in trying to steal the bounty from a team that already grabbed it) you do not have to be \"the last one standing\", you can leave at any time at any of the extraction points that are marked around the map. You'll earn money for every clue you gathered (about the boss location), as well as XP for any zombies and players you killed. You can play quickplay instead of Bounty Hunt. Quickplay is solo only and is more like traditional BR. While there is no circle, your hunter is free and you find weapons in the round. The goal is to find four clues first and it will activate the \"well spring\" which is the game's timer. It starts with 450 seconds on the clock and once you grab it, it starts filling energy for you. Each second of energy = $1 of hunt money. When the timer hits 0, whoever is holding the wellspring will \"save their soul\" and the others are damned and engulfed in flame. So here there can only be one winner but you do not use your hunter, you use a new one each game. If you survive, you can recruit the hunter you escaped with for FREE and he gets all the weapons and XP he earned from the quickplay round. This makes quickplay a great place, even if you die, to earn money with no risk. Just playing it a few times can recoup several Bounty Hunt losses. There is also a training period where your hunters will \"cheat death\" in Bounty Hunt until your bloodline (your overall player account level, this never goes down and is not tied to hunters, it unlocks weapons for you to purchase) level is 16. So you will have some time to adjust. And even then, after every game you can generate a new batch of four hunters to recruit and you will always have a low level hunter that you can recruit for free who will have poor weapons and no perks. This is a great way to keep costs down from losses. There's a lot to this game and it's quite the unique experience. It's most definitely worth playing for anyone even kind of interested in a more unique shooter experience.",

I've spent time hunting people and time being hunted by others. The atmosphere can be something else when there is a stand off and its dark you don't know where the next shot will come from. The lighting and graphics can be amazing or look like potatoes but its still fun and playable. Crytek have removed the Nvidia overlay which has evened the odds graphically (as lighting brightness etc is hugely important in this game)The monsters are uniquely designed and have had alot of thought put into them with each having advantages and disadvantages even during PvP gun fights.Bosses can be frustrating but once you learn how to deal with them are just another stumbling block.Any weapon is deadly in the right hands/situations which leads to some very interesting outcomes for gun fightsCons: There is no tutorial so read everything you can about bullets and guns in the menus.That being said stat recording has made people very competitive since release which makes for some salty players(I've been on of them).Some changes they have made have changed the game in ways some players don't like but I haven't seen them stop playing this game. Most changes have added something as the devs are adding to this game and trying to balance it. In doing so have done well with new guns, traits and hopefully a map soon.Yes there are issues and players complain about it like most games. Still getting a little rubber banding even when playing on servers for my region.Hackers - I've come across hackers and I'm not sure if the devs or easy anticheat are working to minimise this (or even care) but they usually aren't in every match just the odd one every now and then. We (the hunter) report players but dont even know if the devs/easy anticheat care about these \"Reports\". - Update The crytek have been banning hackers regularly which has been helping with this.Extra Info: The DLC does not change the game at all but is just a cosmetic thing which is refreshing consideringh the \"norm\" with DLC nowadays.Ping from this game sometimes can be the difference between winning and fight and not but it usually isnt an issue.Stats dont mean anything. Its more about situation awareness and thinking on your feet.I never know whats going to happen when a match starts. Random stuff happens in the bayou all the time. This is intense and brutaly hard and brilliant.8/10I live in the bayou now....",

                "text": "With the realise of 1.0 the Devs decided to completely change many aspects of the game. One of the initial biggest attractions for many people to Hunt was the fact that the game had a dark, gritty look which was also echoed in the tough, unforgiving nature of the game. It was a slow, tactical game which could burst into action at any moment, whether it be PvP action or you just accidentally wandered in to the middle of a pack of Hellhounds and the resulting noise attracted everything in the vicinity. Unfortunately 1.0 changes a lot of these The graphics are nowhere near as clear or consistent as they were at launch, they have upped the lighting to the point where the once pitch black night is not dark at all. They have reduced the LOD so much that texture pop-ins happen all the time, this is really off putting in a stealth game when you are looking for enemies in the distance in trees/bushes.Up until 1.0 aiming in Hunt was a two step process, One button to bring your gun up into hipfire stance then another button press to bring you into ADS stance. This, along with some pretty severe weapon sway meant that gunfights in Hunt used to require a great deal of skill. Even people with incredible aim couldn't just one tap everyone from anywhere. It meant fights on average lasted longer than other FPS games and this required players to be more than just a 'Good Shot' in engagements, flanking, retreating and re-engaging, using decoys or even triggering AI to help you win fights all happened frequently. However the introduction of 'Gunslinger' mode allows players to bypass the two stage aiming system, with Gunslinger the player is always in hipfire stance, meaning they have an advantage on anyone not using Gunslinger as they only have to press one button to shoot instead of two, and although the Devs claim there is a disadvantage to using Gunslinger I have yet to see where any disadvantage lies. The removal of the weapon sway has meant that anyone with halfway decent aim can get headshots quite easily, both of these changes have reduced the skill ceiling whilst also reducing the average length of gunfights which in turn has seen a reduction in the need to flank etc. This has imo made the game a little boring. If I wanted insanely accurate guns and fast gunfights I wouldn't be playing a game like Hunt as there are so many other games that allow me to play that way easier and with more enjoyment and variance.  They also decided to add a 3d pinging system, it feels so out of place in the game it's ridiculous. I realise they wanted a way for random teams to communicate without using in game VOIP but instead of having the mark only appear on the compass they make it 3d, reducing a huge skill in the game which was being able to quickly and accurately describe the location of an enemy.As far as I'm concerned the Devs have spent over a year and a half making a game that caters to the audience that initially bought the game and supported it an audience that loved the slow paced, stealth and tactical heavy requirements, only for them to turn around and slap those supporters in the face by springing a dumbed down, easier to play and more accessible to the average player version of the game just before full launch. It reeks of a lack of confidence in the original concept and gameplay and stinks of a company who are struggling financially screwing over those that where there when needed in order to chase that mainstream cash. I've been eagerly awaiting the full release of this game for nearly 2 years and I couldn't be more disappointed in the outcome.Edit to add: I didn't realise that 1.0 increased the price to \u00a336 for the little content in this game (two maps, 3 Bosses) it really isn't worth it with that price point.",

If you run into town guns blazing and feet stomping you may find every barrel pointed at you. Hunt has some of the best soundscape you can find out there, and the maps are built around it. If you are cautious you can pick out where nearly everyone is. If you are patient and careful you can avoid all of the sound traps and get anywhere near silently. However, you aren't the only one going to your destination, and choosing to sacrifice stealth for speed or speed for stealth is one of the most pivotal decisions you will be making constantly. Hunt is a hard game, but its not frustrating. Its rare when I think my death wasn't justified, where there wasn't something I could have done to get out of it. When I die in a game and I say \"that was my fault\" its a well designed game. Definitely look up a guide or two if you give it a try.

                "text": "I don't usually write reviews for games, but saying that Hunt: Showdown is worthy of the time spent here is an understatement. Hunt is a tense, immersive, adrenaline-pumping first person bounty hunting game with a classic western 19th century setting. Without further ado, lets break it down.Immersion is usually chalked up to be a marketing buzz word employed by game development companies to describe a rich world with detail and accurate elements of life.The belief that something could be real is exponentially more captivating than reality itself. Daily life is all too familiar, while fantasy is outlandish. Blend the two and you get Hunt's immersive element. The true to life weaponry, realistic movement, and fantastic sound design are the main life-like elements of Hunt, while grotesque monsters and hellish dark powers bring something exciting to the table. These two halves make an amazing whole that keeps you interested in the world of Hunt.From rugged revolvers to repeaters and rending shotguns, Hunt has something for every situation. Sprinkled in are surprises like the Bomb Lance, a harpoon style weapon with a massive fixed blade and spring loaded explosive harpoons. Snipers like the prairie rifle Sparks LRR and time tested Mosin have scoped options for extreme range. Recently added dual wielding allows you take a matched pair of your favorite sidearms for the ultimate gunslinging experience. Unique throwables like bundled sticks of dynamite, firebombs, barbed wire cages, and even nasty hive bug bombs that chase down and poison your enemies. Maybe you fancy a double barrel shotgun? How about dual silenced revolvers and a silent rifle for some sneaky runs? Hunt has it all. Try everything and find what works best. The AI elements of Hunt are not to be underestimated. Most games with extra enemies will spawn the equivalent of trash mobs, posing little threat to the mission. Forget steamrolling through PVE. Massive meatheads with hooks guard clues in various locations. Fiery immolator demons run at Usain Bolt speed and can explode if shot or sliced by sharp weapons. Hive abominations are transformed women that have their rib cage erupted and heads nearly detached from their body, now inhabited by swarms of poisonous bugs that track and prevent their target from healing. The bosses are pure hell spawn and are just as gross as the rest. A gigantic spider warped from a human's body lurks in the dark, waiting to pounce and sink its massive teeth into an unsuspecting hunter. The Butcher lumbers about, shaking the ground as he stomps towards hunters with a fiery meat hook and disgusting leeches poking from his pig head and body. Lastly, the Assassin transforms from a swarm of bugs to a tall human-like figure, with long knives coming out of its wrists. The enemies in Hunt will keep you engaged at all times. Be prepared and bring lots of healing!In Hunt, you have one main objective; extract with the bounty from the banished monster(s). This is accomplished by using a special power called dark sight to locate clues scattered around the map. Once you have located three clues, the bounty target location will be marked precisely on your map. You do not need clues to find the bounty target, as you may stumble upon them by luck or other means, but clues are the consistent way to do so. Once you have your location, you must go and kill the monster target at said location. After death, the monster needs to be banished. Banishing takes time and marks the location on the map for all players to see, so set up and hold your ground! After banishing, grab the bounty from the dead monster and head for extraction. Dark sight is a provisionary measure that will allow bounty holders to see other hunters in a 150 meter range for a limited time, due to the fact that non carriers can see hunters in dark sight with lightning above their heads. Be quick and get out on time! Other teams of hunters will be trying to accomplish the same goal, whether it be a two boss map or just one. Matches are never the same and different hunters and weapons make the gameplay very engaging, as you will want to improve constantly. You can play solo, duos, or trios, but there is no dedicated solo mode, which means at the very least you will be fighting duos if you go solo in Bounty Hunt. Quickplay, a solo mode that has you save a damned hunter for a chance for free equipment, and Trials, as well as tutorials, are all available for your perusal. One final note, you will notice that sound is your friend. Use it. - Some GuyFrom the above sections of the review, you can probably gather that I enjoy this game. No game is perfect, however, and this wouldn't be a proper review without recognizing the flaws of this product. The main issues with Hunt can be summed up into three things:This game is hard on new players, without a doubt. Hunt has a smaller community made up of a lot of experienced players. In the beginning, expect to die a decent amount, especially if you try to play solo in Bounty Hunt and Quickplay (Quickplay is solo only). I recommend finding people or friends to play with to increase your chances of survival. The Official Hunt: Showdown Discord is a great place to start. I'll link them below for your convenience. The User Interface of Hunt is also quite an annoyance at times, with many different ways to sort for weapons and blood bonds being a thing can be confusing. Watching any Hunt YouTuber will help understand the workings of the UI a bit better, especially if you're confused about Blood Bonds. Finally, the ping issues can happen from time to time and other related disconnects are uncommon, but present. Make sure you select the right regions for playing!First off, if you've made it this far, I applaud you. This is quite a long review and I thank you for reading through it. Secondly, take everything above with a grain of salt. You won't truly know if you enjoy the game without actually giving it a try. Now that we have that out of the way, lets finish this up. Hunt is unlike any First Person Shooter I've played in a long time. I am always looking for something new to shake up the genre and Hunt does just that. Fantastic gameplay and a truly immersive world has kept me going for 300 hours and I plan to sink many more into it. Hunt is criminally underrated in my personal opinion and offers a lot for the price tag. I hope to see you in the Bayou, hunter!",

Many writers of later generations are deeply influenced by him, including the founder of the myth of \"Lovecraft\" and the famous degree of the novel. Even \"Lu Xun\" mentioned him in the article.The representative works are black cat and crowHe has been in the army in his life and has reached the highest rank of \"Sergeant chief\" among the soldiersSpecific design ideasThe background is a novelist. You can write whatever you wantMy idea about weapons isLegendary axe (corresponding to black cat)And a random gun called \"nevermore\" (this is what the \"crow\" says in the poem \"the crow\")Another significance is that when a dead person is killed with a gun, there will be a scream. Isn't it like the cry of a crow?And the official crow man boss will come out soon, which is very similar to the style of Allan PoeOf course, this is just my idea, and if the authorities are interested, I will be very happy, even if I am only seen.

                "text": "It's been a while since Ryse: Son of Rome, the last AAA Crytek-developed game I played. I am also familiar with their Crysis franchise. I was glad to read the news on a western-themed FPS software. I found it interesting that instead of the story this game would be focusing on multiplayer. It's been 3 years since Hunt Showdown was released (originally under the early access concept) and new content has been added ever since. With a friend or 2 (or alone if we're brave enough) our job is to look for clues in a huge map. A special visibility mode helps with the search. The aim here is to find information on a boss (or 2 bosses) that are considered the bounties during our match. Once the boss is found we, naturally, have to eliminate it. These are monsters - terrifying, otherwordly creatures - that hide inside a large building. As the 2nd stage is done we begin banishing the vanquished creature. Consider it an automatically applied spell that takes some time and we have to remain in position. After that we can pick up our well-deserved bounty and go to one of the extraction points that are randomly chosen.Interesting, right? This is the PvE part of the game but it is PvP as other hunters also look for the same bounty. It is my understanding that matches support up to 12 players. It can be very annoying when you finally eliminate the boss and then you're suddenly shot down. Or during extraction (there is a timer of 30 seconds here) you are killed before taking home your well-deserved reward.The setting may be the late 1800s but not your usual one. The story takes place in Louisiana so expect a lot of swamps with trees and - most importantly - otherwordly creatures. There are grunts (living dead but often with melee weapons), armored grunts, hell hounds, zombies on fire (immolators), undead releasing swarms of insects at you from a distance (hives) and even the devil (?) is trying to get you in the water if you are not careful. As if all had come from a Lucio Fulci classic.The sound design is superb in this game be it your steps or the noises an enemy makes. You need to be careful when moving around - stepping on broken glasses just after entering a building or bumping your head into a bunch of hanging horseshoes can all be giveaways. I have played every single match with my headset on and it was worth it. Interestingly, ingame voice chat when used can also be heard if other players are close. People use Discord or Steam's built-in version instead.Consider them your heroes. You have some already available but more can be recruited for money. They level up individually as you complete matches but your profile also has ranks. Higher ranks unlock more traits (abilities) that you can assign to your hunters as well as new weapons. Remember, this is the Wild West (or South...) so expect to reload after every single shot. This is not running and gunning like in a Call of Duty game. A dinamite takes much longer to explode than a grenade. Oh, dinamites. There are a lot of throwables, traps, even several choices for melee weapons. The DLCs here mean purely cosmetic items (better skins for the afore-mentioned). Legendary heroes are a bit different - beside the cosmetic aspect (they look unique) and the short bio they come with these hunters have randomly assigned traits. They can come handy at the beginning but they will never have weapons on them.I'm based in Europe but I picked US East Coast as the secondary location for matches. Often one is found in the second group only. In general, finding matches takes long. If there is just one boss players hardly advance to find clues but instead camp out and wait for you. The game resurrects your hunters until you reach rank 11. It warns you that after that your hunters will perish forever. The legendary ones (DLC) you can always buy again but every time they start out as level 1. So, you lose all traits and all weapons. Why from rank 11? If you complete a match and die you only get half the XP. Two groups of people will never level up at the same speed following the same number of matches. When you get shot you see your enemy was a level 1 hunter, for instance. But before moving onto spectating you can check the other players' profiles. They may be level 1 but the statistical data shown to you is surprising (and disappointing): dozens or even hundreds of bosses or duo groups eliminated already and dozens of hunters retired (advisable once your hunter has reached the max level). As you can see from the above the game is extremely unforgiving. Beginners (or noobs in the vocabulary of some) are punished if mistakes are made. I always spectate and check the other players - I usually see players with ranks between 60 and 100. No newcomers? It's been 3 years and a 3rd map is about to be released and really we have a small playerbase consisting of veterans mostly? You can pick the \"skill-based\" option before starting matchmaking but if the other player has played hundreds of hours already he is better with the same level 1 hunter. Not to mention the kind of gear available for them already. The pop-up message can say we are equally based but, in fact, this is not true, at all.Apart from the above the game is gorgeous. The atmosphere is unique and it makes absolute no sense playing it without a headset on. It is unfortunate that matchmaking has issues, that the game is harsh to newcomers and that beside the usual bountyhunting there is only one other game mode available which puts emphasis on solo play. With the track record of some great story-based games I wish Crytek added a single player mode. I recommend the game due to its unique atmosphere and slow-paced gameplay style but you have to remember I'm (still) at the very beginning while I have so far invested 20 hours. This is not a \"easy to learn, hard to master\" type of game if that is what you're looking for. The score in particular is great in the main menu!",

I have played over 2k hours and I still get jump scared and the Adrenalin you get during hunter fights/clutches are just immense.  You need a mid range CPU (i7 6700k/Ryzen 5) + a half decent GPU (980ti/1070/Radeon rx590) and 8+ DDR (2200+).  With a little optimisation I can play this game 90+ frames with my 4yr old PC.Every bounty consists of locating clues, tracking enemy hunters using sound and visuals, killing bounties and finally escaping! Max 10 players per map consisting of duo + solo mixed.  It's not just a challenge to kill players (hunters) but it can be a challenge to kill PVE monsters too.  Combining these threats together makes it hardcore!If you want hardcore PVP with a mixture of PVE, super satisfying wins and amazing graphics then this is your title.",

In two days I've played 20 hours and I don't see myself getting bored anytime soon.The meta has so many layers to it. There are a bunch of ways you can choose to play depending on your playstyle, and the permanent death of your characters leads to a much more realistic suspense. You progress your character through playing missions, and if you die at any point, you must start with a new character and equipment. You can choose to steal other people's guns in game and permanently keep them. The missions aren't to kill the other players, but rather to kill the bounty(s), banish them (wait a few minutes until you can collect the bounty token), and extract with the bounty token(s) at one of the extraction points. The further you progress, the more information other players know about you, and the riskier the situation gets. You never know how many people are left, and chances are if you have a bounty token, they are coming to kill you to steal it. If you aren't confident that you can win, you can extract at any time to save your bounty hunter. All these gameplay aspects lead to very interesting dynamics. Are we the last ones left? Should we extract with this one bounty or should we go for the second? Are people gonna ambush us when we go to extraction? Am I making too much noise?Buy the game.",

                "text": "- Hunt: Showdown is an  (the official title) Here are my thoughts after 12+ hours of ups and downs with it.Hunt: Showdown is a game where your task is to recruit bounty hunters, take them into bounty hunt missions, come back from the missions alive, gear up and do it again. There is some unknown epidemic affecting the living deep in the Louisiana bayous and you\u2019re sent there to hunt down some tough supernatural demons. During the hunt you encounter these creepy, infested humans and dogs that aren\u2019t friendly towards outsiders. Amongst them are other bounty hunters as well, going for the same target as you.Hunt: Showdown is a pure FPS game, which is the only way to go with a game like this. There are multiple examples of games where the 3rd person view just makes no sense, kills the gameplay and only works as an \u2018exploit\u2019. So no, there\u2019s no weird camera angles where you can peek over walls to get an upper hand towards an approaching hunter.You can go on a bounty hunt Solo, Team up with another random bounty hunter or Invite/Join one of your Steam friend. The game has an in-built VOIP system which works rather nicely. The distance between you and the other person determines how loud your voice can be heard. Everyone can hear you if they\u2019re close enough, so keep that in mind if you\u2019re trying to avoid the attention of other hunters. Even the chat has a radius too, so prepare for some hilarious \u201cOMG, I think he\u2019s near us. I can hear his footsteps.\u201d Comments every now and then. Or the classis \u201cI told you so.\u201d When you shoot someone, and leave his buddy alive.Every time you go out, your main task is to find clues from your bounty\u2019s location. The bounty hunters have a supernatural skill called dark sight, that helps you with a general direction of these clues. After finding a clue, the highlighted area in your map decreases until finally you get a red marker showing where the target is.And since you\u2019re not the only one in the hunt, prepare for some conflicts; silly wabbits camping in the bushes, interrupted boss fights, stolen bounties or just a random friendly winchester slug in your forehead \u2013 just because. Greed and glory.The year is 1895 and your bounty hunters are armed with winchesters, revolvers and shotguns from that era. When you recruit a new hunter, you get a list of four random bounty hunters with various weapons, equipment and traits \u2013 the better one\u2019s cost a bit more. You can have max 5 hunters in your roster same time and their price ranges between 50 to 150 dollars. You are then free to equip your hunters with whatever gear you choose, just keeping in mind that if the hunt isn\u2019t going well and your hunter might not come back, you\u2019ll lose him and all his juicy equipment permanently. Luckily basic firearms cost around 4-15 dollars, so there rarely is a point where you can\u2019t  afford to gear up your guys. After a hunt ends, you are scored with experience points and money according to your actions in the hunt. Every monster, hunter, boss kill, collected clue etc. rewards points in both categories. If you die in the middle of a hunt, you only get half of the rewards.With these experience points you level up your total profile level and hunter\u2019s personal level. Profile levels unlock more weapons and equipment in the hunter store, where hunter\u2019s level determines how many upgrade points he has for health and various trait boosts.As I\u2019m writing this (24th Feb 2018) you can\u2019t pick up any firearms (only melee weapons like hammers, axes etc) when you\u2019re in a hunt. There is no corpse looting (player or npc). Map is full of randomly scattered supply points, healing kits and weapon storages to keep you going, though trigger happy hunters might face a hard time when the ammo count eventually runs low.The main selling point here to me is the balance between PvE and PvP. Fighting the monsters is great, but there\u2019s always that sense of danger looming in the background, knowing you\u2019re not the only one in the Hunt, keeping you on your toes. Should you shoot these foul creatures, maybe try avoiding them all together or use a machete and avoid drawing too much attention?The main idea here is not the PvP combat, but it is a BIG chunk of the experience and definitely adds some thrill and excitement to the monster hunt. The sounds play a big part in the game: the sounds of scared crows, distant gun shots, footsteps, water splashes, broken glass, metal chains hanging on walls and ceiling, a pack of barking dogs in a kennel or spooked chickens in a coop \u2013 just by listening carefully you known a lot what\u2019s happening around you. (Hearing impaired? Sadly there are no indicators or HUD symbols to turn on from the options, but who knows\u2026 Maybe at some point.)It is possible to try avoiding conflicts with other players completely, gather some clues, maybe bash few creepy monster heads in, then extract from the mission with your hunter still alive. You don\u2019t HAVE TO kill the bounty target and deliver the bounty to extraction every time. As I\u2019m writing this, there\u2019s currently only one (rather big) map available in game, with two different bounties to hunt. You can choose a day light or night time hunt, which ever suits your playstyle better. There\u2019s few hiccups here and there like in any Early Access title and the dev team keeps updating us very often about the situation (server reboots, maintenance etc.)I read that there are no plans of account wipes or resets during the further developement (unless some major update or bug prevents bringing the current savegames/profiles to the release version) so your current progress from Early Access stays to the full game.--I have enjoyed the game throughly, even when I lose my favorite hunters by some stupid error or just because I got played. I've been doing solo runs, even some very succesfull ones where I manage to take down multiple hunters and deliver the bounty back too. Teaming up with random hunters is nice too, though I still think the game is at it's best when playing with friends.Very entertaining, has HUGE potential and I'll gladly wait for some new maps and new hunts!",

Don\u2019t let the small amount of players per match deter you from playing as the numerous AI infected can overwhelm you just as fast as any player and they provide a good mixture for both types of players. The graphics and audio are absolutely amazing the first time you play you\u2019ll be blown away with the amount of quality that the developers have put into the game. If any of this has intrigued you I highly recommend giving this game a try.",

You, along with other players, will break an important quarantine, self-imposed by the citizens of the region, in order to massacre not only them, but each other as well, bringing chaos, mayhem, and ruthless violence to aggravate these poor people even further.You can tread the corpses of your victims on your own, or invite friends to tag along in your gruesome rampage, as you hunt the bounties put on the most beloved community leaders of Stillwater Bayou and Lawson Delta. You can customize your loadout so that the weapons of your preference are available to inflict pain and losses to the inhabitants of Louisiana's marshes.The more you murder, the better you become at it, as long as you leave these zones with impunity. If your sins are left unpunished by the environment or by other players, you famously 'live to die another day', which means only God Himself will strike you down with the mighty hand of vengeance.You can purchase legendary characters with in-game currency, or through DLC. These are the typical characters you would expect to find on the Deep South of the US in the 19th Century, such as a Japanese samurai, a dead guy, or even a monstrous man who covers his shame of being a lawyer with the mask from the Phantom of the Opera. One can't help but feel that a game with a perk named 'Tomahawk' is lacking some types of playable characters. Yet I can't put my finger on it.All in all, this is a perfect game for terrible people like myself: filthy rats who will stalk somebody who honestly spent their time killing a boss, only to stab them in the back and steal the bounty away. If you can handle this, and the high adrenaline rush after several minutes of quiet, then this is the game for you. The feeling of triumph after a victory, whether hard-earned or sly and malicious, tastes sweet all the same.",

Leave it in the development oven for a bit methinks.-Multiplayer doesn't work at all for me or my friends. -Sometimes sound doesn't work, I've had doors opened an arms length away from me while I'm crouched waiting for a banish and it makes no sound and all the sudden I get a shotgun to the head. -\"Something went wrong\" Get used to it.-You need a pretty decent rig to run it, though that's kind of expected in Early Access.-Really long queue/load times, I'd say 10 minutes roughly.Beyond all that if you're still interested, it's a good game at it's core, going in solo, if you do manage to go against another set of players, they don't seperate solo queue and duo queue, and if you die, well, you can't be picked up.However, if you solo queue with a friend you can still \"team up\" because each bounty has \"two charges\" so you can both take a cut, kinda neat and an alright fix for it. Guns feel pretty good, imo, not so much when a quiet door opens and you get shot in the back of the head but eh, I'm sure things will be fixed with time. If you already don't like spiders this game might scare the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 out of you. I'm optimistic for it's future, but we'll see how it goes.",

Hunt: Showdown is hard to grasp in the first few matches, but once it clicks, this game is one of the most tense but fair experiences I've had in a game. The way the game incorporates binaural sound as a primary game mechanic is fantastic. You KNOW someone is coming if they stumble on some crows or run over glass, and can pinpoint exactly where they are just by sound alone. Hunt reminds me a lot of Rainbow Six: Siege, but a lot more fair. Staking out a bounty while everyone is bearing down on you is intense and awesome, and you can easily figure out where enemies are coming from just by sound. However, just because you get one shot off doesn't guarantee a kill.I do have some minor gripes with the game. Even with these issues, this game is an easy recommendation as long as you're okay with lots of lethality and are into more niche multiplayer games. I'm definitely going to put a lot more hours into this one",

Having said that, i spent around 20 hours in the alpha, without getting a single bounty out of a match. I died. I died every time.But the game was stunning, amazing atmosphere and the gunplay felt incredible. After the alpha ended and the early access came out, i got a copy immediately. I tried getting my friends to play with me but no one was particularly thrilled. I bought 4 other copies to those who seemed interested cause i really wanted to play with them. My best friend started playing with me, even though our rigs were very similar and the performance we got out of them was laughable. But we still played. He fell in love with the game just as much as i did. Not long after that we invested in upgrading our pc's mainly for Hunt: Showdown. We're no way near close being die-hard competitive players, even with nearly 800 hours in I'm only rank 596 while he's 496, we play for fun but our ultimate goal is to win. We joke around a lot, try ridiculous things as well as try to befriend other players, share our bounties and generally be nice to other players. Which sometimes bites us in the ass. But we have fun. We always have fun, each match. I haven't enjoyed a game like this in a while, Hunt has given me a lot of great time, the atmosphere in this game is unreal. No game manages to get my heart beating like Hunt does. The thrill of hunting other players and the uncertainty of not knowing if another player is currently watching all your moves gives me quite a rush. I would play this game nearly everyday, i wouldn't play anything else besides Hunt. I took a bit of a break from Hunt after some 700 hours. Not because i didn't enjoy it, but because i also wanted to play something less challenging, something that wasn't as punishing and unforgiving. Came back to this game couple days ago and the game still feels great. Crytek, i will always recommend this game. I will always try to support it. You guys do an amazing job with this game.Some might say your decisions aren't in the best interest for the die-hard fans of this game, and though i might agree with some of those statements, no one can deny the fact that you guys put serious effort into this game. It is hard to satisfy the wishes of the whole community, but you're doing great. Keep on with the amazing work.",

There's elements from battle royales, co-op shooters, first person arpgs, tactical fps, and from all the in-betweens.

Good risk vs gain ratio for expensive guns.Awesome PvE. Scary monsters. Satisfactory kills . Great sound. Makes game very atmospheric. Various weakspots on various enemies. If you walk into a pack of 4 hellhounds at night you dead. Some monsters cause bleeding, some burning that can permanently reduce your health. Some give poison.Great map. Shame it's only one. I expect this game to have at lest 4 like this one at launch and more gradually added further down the line when the rest is finished.However it is large and detailed and varied enough that in some 40 hours I am not bored yet. Far from. And you get it in version night and day.From what I have seen so far, every single object piece was designed with thought, care, lots of easter eggs. Great places designed for gunfights and boss fights, always many possibilities of entering objects, some noisier than others, some requiring 2 people. And you have to walk through all of it to get ammo, medkits and clues to boss location.Also very gruesome, gore porn, perfect theme.Stealth big category on itself: dead horses everywhere but some raise their heads when you come close and let out a loud shriek, monster agro makes noise, crows fly off and alert to you, glass and cans littered on ground. Cans and bottles and chains hanging from ceiling, very good difference between varied surface types when walking. Monsters dont hear you when crouched. At night is harder to see. You can start up a loud generator that turns on spotlights to light up area for defense.Overall, there is just so much game here. When I was a kid I wanted action figures that bend in arms, elbows, knees, the more the better. Well in this game you can bend even the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 toes and transform into optimus prime too.CONS:Very campy. Meta is often people get campy and wait for someone to kill boss and then grab the bounty as they try to extract it. Easy to do since you can see on the map where the person with bounty is and where they are going. Person with bounty has no benefit.How I think it should be:Killing boss should be more incentivized, most gunfights should happen at boss during banishment because people should want to take bounty. Because bounty should also give you boss' powers and thus double your hp and give you location of all the remaining players in darksight so if someone grabs the buff, everyone else should run to extract not to camp bounty but to save their puny lives from new bosses. And 25 bucks for every hunter killed while I carry a bounty damnit.",

                "text": "\"Game is hella expensive but I still find it worth every penny for it is undoubtedly the most wholesome, most relaxing RPG experience I've ever had.The yuri vibe in this one is quite strong. With or without intimate content, possibly the best yuri themed RPG to have ever hit the shelves, a.k.a. my dream game. If you are a yuri fan, I think every minute of this game is to be savored. I'm sure post-game depression is going to hit hard with this one.\"-my review at 16 hours of playtime--------------------------------------------------------------------------Now that I've finished the game once, and post-game depression does hit hard, I feel the urge to elaborate on my old review..First off, actually my favorite game currently. One of the best game experience I've had in a while.===About the game===This game is basically a school setting fantasy anime with a twist, the twist being you are in it as the protagonist. If you've watched any of those such as Guilty Crown or Angel Beats, it's going to feel very familiar. The game does a terrific job at establishing the atmosphere of \"living a carefree life as a high school student on a summer vacation\". The story itself is a bit clich\u00e9, but is still interesting and enhanced by the whole concept of being in an empty school in an unpopulated alternate world. This concept alone makes the game feel very relaxing to play, there's no rush to do anything, you can explore the world and socialize with your friends to your heart's content.The game feels a lot like Nier: Automata, not only because of some of the later maps, but the general atmosphere of being in an isolated world too. Just felt like pointing that out because I love that game as well.===Gameplay===A pleasant mix of JRPG combat, base building, and dating-sim...? (kind of). Combat is easy to follow and pretty cool. As a JRPG combat system, it's neither too slow and bland nor too complicated, with its fair share of uniqueness. Character customization with the talent and fragment system is a nice touch, reminiscent of the classic Final Fantasy 7 and 8, and is undeniably fun.Base building - its existence alone in this game is pretty great, especially considering the game's setting, albeit a bit held back by the lack of ability to customize or actually interact with them. Pseudo-dating-sim - Just awesome. It's basically the game's means of character development, but you get to experience it more personally. The dating events are all wholesome and cute, and makes you come to love the characters so you can better enjoy the whole experience.===Characters===The entire cast of characters are lovable, some of them relatable, and all of them simply amazing. The voice-acting is spot on - exactly what you would expect from watching a good anime. They each have their own distinct personality, and learning their backstories and interacting with them are a total joy. Character development is done very well, so as the story goes on, you grow to love every one of the characters, making it easy to fully immerse yourself in the setting.===Visuals & Music===Vast world with photo-realisitc textures like in Forza Horizon 5? No.Beautiful world that makes exploration absolutely enjoyable? Yes.Everything in this game is pleasing to look at. Everywhere I go I feel is worthy of a screenshot, and there are places that are clearly designated photo spots. Combining the gorgeous scenery with a lovable crew, the photo mode is really a great tool to spend some time playing around with. Actually feels like a vacation trip, and gives off a nostalgic feel.Music - unique, catchy, and overall great. Sets the mood perfectly throughout the game and never gets old.===Yuri content===Even though there's no intimate interactions between characters or anything of the sorts except holding hands I guess, there is certainly a mild yuri vibe in the air throughout the game that I'm sure yuri fans can appreciate. My statement from old review still stands, I think it's the best yuri themed RPG out there.===Conclusion===All aspects are done decently, leaving not much to complain about. It's a fairly standard modern JRPG, with a brilliant setting and extra immersion.In addition, there's always this mood of nostalgia throughout the whole game, the feeling of being young, full of energy, and surrounded by wonderful friends. It makes the game feel very special, at least for me.For all of the above, I consider this absurdly priced game to be very much worth it, and I can't wait for a third game in the series.",

From its characters that unfolds better to the actual gameplay, which ends up being richer. Blue Reflection: Second Light strikes in with a story that works as a soft reboot to ensure new players and as a continuation of what was narrated in the first game and anime altogether, to please those who have already experienced the franchise in the past. The \"magical girl\" legacy that this franchise is keeping to its heart is still going strong and faithful, even if the world and the thematic are changing from the first game. Second Light succeds in finding a way to retain what actually means to be a \"magical girl\" while pushing to give something more, that was never presented before, without resulting excessive superfluous.If there's one thing that seems to be annoying, is that the fast-paced style of the combat, while still resulting frenetic and fun, doesn't make justice to the animation overall, as the player doesn't have the time to look and appreciate what's happening on the screen because keeping the pace of the battle is a core part of the gameplay. For this reason, I hope Gust is going to implement a \"Pause Animation Option\" to ensure a pause when the girls attack during a battle. With such options, attacks would be divided from animation that a player can appreciate while the fight would still end up being frenetic and fast. I already hope for a 3rd game for main consoles and PC!",

                "text": "Long time ago, I had a discussion with community, \u2018If one day, you get ONE ticket to a game world, you are granted to travel there and live there forever, but you won\u2019t be able to come back, which game will you choose to go?\u2019 The answers were vary. To me, the answer is: the world of Blue a Reflection, there isn\u2019t another. As a long time fan of Blue Reflection, I am not going to praise 2nd Light sky high like I did to the first game, instead, I want to use this review to help the franchise at very least has the possibilities to improve even further for the future titles, since the 2nd game is different from the first one, we have the opportunity to see a larger scale of the world setting of the game; a bigger cast than the first one too. Before I get myself started, I\u2019d like to state: 2nd Light has changed many things comparing to the first game, and improved A LOT regarding to combat system, general gameplay. There isn\u2019t any doubt that Gust put tons of ideas and thought into making 2nd Light a better game, and did a great job to deliver the final product to meet fans\u2019 expectations.This is where we begin to see the true potential of 2nd Light, though the game seems lacks of the depth of the developments of these ideas. Starting with combat strategy & bosses fights.I love every single character in the game, the art, costumes, personalities, interacted conversations, everyone is different and unique. And that\u2019s exactly why I felt like the combat needs more work in order to let everyone standing in the front equally. What does this mean? Alright, I will give specific examples here. We have 6 reflectors instead of 3 in 2nd Light who can participate in battle, while having one support slot to choose one more reflector who will be supporting members in battle instead of fighting directly, only switching in if the tide of the combat changes. 3 place for 3 reflectors, huh? Classic. However, Ao\u2019s combat efficiency is somehow bond with Kokoro, because her ability is doing high critical damage when enemies are under debuff status ailments and Kokoro has tons of abilities that inflecting negative ailments while doing damage. Which made them a duo, either one of them alone in battle isn\u2019t going to achieve the max potential and efficiency they\u2019re capable of, despite you can still do that as you like. Meanwhile Ao chan is the protagonist of the game, and the ONLY character in 2nd Light who has Combo Guard which is a skill that prevent combo reset from bosses\u2019 special attacks. Which means, Ao is a must in boss fight, because long combo count= high damage, especially for higher difficulties. So logically, Kokoro would tag along, then only leaves one last placeholder for a reflector, in the other word, 1 out of 4 to choose. The problem here is, Shiho chan is so OP in the game, she\u2019s like the Goddess of War, who can do massive damage alone while providing healing and curing status ailment which made her almost pointless to be replaced by others. Other 3 reflectors either is healing focus character(Rena chan) or damage types( Hinako & Hiori chan) who will rely on consumable items to heal or equip healing amour fragment for healing on boss fights which again, doesn\u2019t seems necessary while Shiho chan gets both problem solved solely.Don\u2019t get me wrong, I am not saying Shiho can\u2019t be OP, she is a formidable reflector in battle and very heartwarming character in the story. She is my favorite girl and I love her from the bottom of my heart. I\u2019m not complaining the difficulty is low on my first play-through either, I know Gust can easily make a game very difficult if they wanted to. What I am talking about here is: the variety of situations of boss fights 2nd Light lacks of WITHOUT increasing the difficulty. You know, even you can oneshot enemies, there are still many ways about how you oneshot them. The combination of Shiho, Ao and Kokoro(SAK) had done 95% of the situation in battle which got me rarely using the other reflectors in general. Because during the long game progress, I have more than enough opportunities to test which combination is the most effective against foes, SAK was the star-champion all the time.Now, let\u2019s imagine a different situation the game doesn\u2019t have, what if there is an elite demon/ boss who has a massive chunk of health, it start attacking your party with low damage, the longer you battle it, its attack becomes more and more devastating, eventually, if you couldn\u2019t kill it in time, it will oneshot your teammate that you won\u2019t be able to revive them in time. Well obviously, my SAK is all-in offensive type, and will be no good in a situation like this, this is Rena chan comes to play. Rena has very high defense value and healing ability, by equipping all kinds of defensive fragments and the fragment that taunt enemies to attack her, she will be a sentinel role which likely would be crucial to a fight like this. If we had these type of enemies, Rena will no longer be sitting on the supporting seat only, doing healing and curing status ailments most of the times. Isn\u2019t this a better respect for her after all? Boss\u2019s 2nd phase?Though there is a boss that you need to beat it several times during the story, but instead of beating it over and over with the same team members, why not separate 6 reflectors who participate in battle into 2 teams, using the support girls who doesn\u2019t join in battle directly as a support per fight? The idea may not be original, but I found it\u2019s actually suit 2nd Light the best, since everyone levels up equally whether they join the battle or not, and there are more than enough fragments to equip, making every reflector in a ready-to-fight statement. If there are bossses kinda forcing you to form 2 different teams to fight at the same time, I dunno, in a different phase or stage maybe, and everyone gets chance to participate in battle, while putting gamers\u2019 understanding of each reflector\u2019s strength and weakness to test, isn\u2019t it one stone with two birds? For example, Hinako chan may not have combo guard to stop bosses from breaking the combo chain, but her special ability adds combo count instantly and support other teammates to gain temporary ability to do so. Couldn\u2019t she be the leading role of the 2nd team seems to me? She seems fine to fight a boss with 2 other reflectors along, while team one -Ao is busy with the other boss?I haven\u2019t studied deeply enough about how Hiori can do her maximize efficiency in battle on my first finished walkthrough, definitely gonna research more about her on my returning 2nd run. Still, it will be much appreciated if we ever get another awesome BF game some time, there are situations she\u2019s a must in combat just like I listed above for others rather than players are desperately creating an opportunity to use her because we love everything about her dearly too. Last thing in this section, I\u2019d advise one thing, the support slot is a great idea, though using purely support girls might be a even better way for reasons (a)every character is making contributions to the fight by doing so, not just in cutscene stories, it means a lot to the world of BF; (b)because of the existence of support fragments, I found there isn\u2019t any point to switch a character in the middle of the fights, rather than fully prepared 3 set reflectors from the start. Reflector who has equip half of her fragment slots with support fragments won\u2019t be that helpful and efficient in battle comparing the status she\u2019s powered by fully equipped battle fragments, it\u2019s better just let the support role being a full supporter all the time helps a lot which is a waste to let a battle participator doing so, don\u2019t you think?Deja vu of Ryza ?Ao chan is a likable character, there\u2019s nothing wrong about being a tomboy, there isn\u2019t any problem to use a tomboy as protagonist in the game. But don\u2019t you feel like Blue Reflection 2nd Light is a bit too Deja vu of Ryza?  Please see the comments below to finish",

                "text": "A massive improvement over the original. Would I recommend playing the original before jumping into the sequel? I would say yes simply because of returning characters and it gives you more insight into the universe of Blue Reflection despite all of it's faults.Second Light improves on everything the first did including a better port, Gust seem to be getting better at porting to PC while other KT properties are either hit or miss (Warriors Orochi 4 had a good port while Fatal Frame V and Ninja Gaiden collection had rather lazy ports). As for the new additions there is a faster more in depth combat system similar to what Atelier Ryza has. There is more playable characters (BR1 was limited to 3). They also added the two leads from the anime as playable characters, which I haven't finished. The level design has been vastly improved while also giving you more ways to trek across each area. Seriously, the level design in the first wasn't great. There is also live banter while exploring dungeons which give the characters more personality and makes the game more lively. Ao has the ability to date other girls which the first game kinda let you do. Another improvement and one I'm glad about is the overhaul of the progression systems. In BR1, Hinako and the girls didn't level up in a traditional manner instead they gain skill points from interacting with other characters in the game meaning the only thing combat rewarded you with was items. In the second game they scrapped that and added in a traditional leveling system through combat but also retained some of the original elements. Instead of gaining a single stat point from interacting with characters you get TP points that also level up the relationship you have with each character. The points you get from here can go into one of four trees. These can give a character a slight stat increase or an ability. Mel Kishida's art is as beautiful as it has ever been with high quality character portraits and designs, seriously his character design's in Blue Reflection and the Atelier Arland games are really good. The music still has that laid back feeling it had in the original. The story is also improved from the first because there is a mystery of the girls finding out about their pasts and about the world they currently inhabit. All in all Blue Reflection Second Light improves upon what the original did and it's really like Mel and the guys at Gust really listened to the criticism's the first game got and decided to create an overall better package than their previous outing.The game is peak \"cute girls doing cute things\". As for my favorite girls it looks like a tie between Ao, Kokoro and of course Hinako, the protagonist from the original who returns in this game.",

                "text": "The good: Character interactions - An enjoyable and varied cast of characters that you will get attached to over the course of the story.Visuals & Music- The Heartscapes (dungeons) each have an interesting aesthetic and accompanying music that keeps you interested in what the next one will look and sound like.The bad: Combat system - Reminiscent of Xenosaga from back in the day, where enemies and players operate on an action timeline and you need to try and stop their attacks while getting yours in. What I didn't like was the Combo system and the drive system. Essentially, your characters will grow in power as the fight progresses but to me it felt like needlessly dragging the fight out and makes actions taken early in the fight feel less meaningful because well... they are.Crafting system - Will routinely ask you to gather items but often times will not tell you where they are and/or it involves grinding enemies for drops.Stealth missions - Sneak past spastic enemies while using objects for cover that may or may not actually obfuscate you.Story - If you didn't play the first game and watch the Anime, prepare for much of the exposition to fly over your head.Difficulty - The game's difficulty isn't very balanced. Early on it's a struggle, but about 25% of the way into the game you will basically begin to streamroll most encounters if you get a pre-emptive strike. Even bosses usually arent that dangerous - mostly just HP sponges.The ugly: Localisation - Typos aside, other bizarre narrative changes have taken place like trying to portray these clearly high school girls wearing seifuku as being in college. Even non Japanese speakers will probably pick up on some of the spoken dialogue not matching the English text as some words are fairly common in anime. This narrative change is especially jarring if you are familiar with characters from the previous entries and is borderline gaslighting.Yuri themes - If you're coming in expecting lots of yuri content, there isn't a whole lot of substance outside of one established couple involving two of your party members. The 'dates' the player character goes on could have easily been called 'hang outs' and would probably be more accurate as to how they play out. There is handholding later in the game, but as soon as you reach your 'date' location, the interaction is played straight 95% of the time. Occasionally you can flirt which is played for comedic effect and goes nowhere and there is no ultimate payoff at the end of the game. I believe this is referred to as 'yuri bait'.Fanservice - Unfortunately what the game is probably most infamously known for is the character designer saying some controversial stuff in terms of reducing fanservice. If you have played the first title, you will definitely feel that, but someone new coming into the series will probably not notice. For me personally, if that's truly what the developers wanted to do and weren't being coerced by outside pressure, I don't really care one way or the other. Having said that, the lengths they have gone to in order to ensure no 'naughty' upskirt pictures could be taken is both comical and a bit pathetic. In the end, I enjoyed it for what it was, but several things left a sour taste in my mouth that it tarnished the overall experience enough that I don't think I would have paid the exceedingly high asking price.",

This is a love letter for a niche group of people that support this company throughout the years. It may not sell well with KT pricing policy but at least Gust delivered the game we all wanted from them.If you are a Gust fan (whatever game you like from them) please buy this game because this is a rare case of a company delivering what real fans want despite all corporation bull^* that devs have to deal with in a daily bases to keep making games.Thanks gust for this one.I will comeback after completion to give my final thoughts.",

                "text": "Despite being a sequel to 2017's Blue Reflection, Second Light hardly feels like the same game - but not in a bad way.The short answer is \u201cno, but it\u2019s still recommended if you want the full experience\u201d. Second Light features an entirely new main cast of characters and the story is mostly told without being too reliant on the first. I say mostly because the cast from the first do eventually make their way into this story, but it\u2019s done in a manner that you would be able to understand even without being familiar with them.This extends to the anime adaptation as well: Blue Reflection Ray. I myself did not actually finish that anime yet I had no trouble getting to know the characters from it in the game \u2013 so again, you can just start from Second Light and be completely fine.Despite how simple the combat in the first game was, I kinda liked it. It was effective and perfectly matched the game\u2019s laidback, slice of life feel. Second Light, on the other hand, completely throws that combat system out the window for an active-time battle system \u2013 similar to what we got in the recent Atelier Ryza games.Battles are far faster as a result and with the changes to the ether system, they only get faster the longer you\u2019re in a battle. The MP system is removed entirely and now attacks, skills, and items all consume ether, which is regenerated at different rates per character depending on their stats. That said, I am a bit torn on this system. It is a completely different feel from the previous game and, while cool in theory, it does come with some problems.Mainly, it\u2019s that it takes away a lot of the variety that the first game had with regards to its skills. Whereas in the first game, I was constantly scrolling through my different attacks and figuring out which best to use in a given fight \u2013 this game it is 95% of the time just going to be one of my basic attacks. I would enter a fight, spam A throughout the entire thing, and call it a day.Hard difficulty is not unlocked until you fully clear the game once, so you have to do your first playthrough on normal and I found it to be a bit too easy. Even after I intentionally kept myself underleveled by avoiding a lot of the enemies on the map, I still had no trouble clearing each and every encounter I ran into.Around halfway into the game, I stopped caring to even figure out the best party composition, which skills to unlock, and even what moves I was using \u2013 it hardly mattered with how easy it is and with how the ether mechanic is designed. Just keep spamming those basic attacks and you\u2019ll build up your combo quickly, which in turn allows you to do more damage with your next basic attack and so on.Finishing up the game, I couldn\u2019t escape this feeling that the battle system was just underutilized. It has all these cool mechanics, but the low difficulty and emphasis on building up combo quickly leave it feeling a bit repetitive.In the first game, the level design was some hot garbage \u2013 mostly small groups of pathways and platforms. In Second Light, they went all out. Now there are multiple areas per biome, movement options outside of just\u2026 walking, and some actual exploration elements, even if on the lighter side. The new areas are also far more dense, with more detail put into individual buildings and the overall geography being much more varied.Having to do fetch quest after fetch quest just to get to the next chapter in the first game was some incredibly boring stuff, so I was very happy to see that done away with entirely in Second Light. Now, side quests are just that \u2013 optional side quests. That said, they\u2019re also more varied. Aside from the usual \u201ccraft this for me\u201d or \u201ckill this enemy for me\u201d, a lot of them now have you build unique school development stuff \u2013 stuff that you actually can use outside of that individual side quest.There are even some side quests that straight up expand on individual characters by having you explore different areas with them to unlock their memories. You sometimes have to do some boring stealth missions, but it\u2019s at least much better off than the filler that the first game had.It still has the same overall school-magical girl theme told across different character arcs, but there is FAR more focus placed on a larger, more connected story instead of just rushing things right at the end like the last game. Character arcs are almost immediately tied into this bigger story and the game does a great job balancing out character development with this larger mystery.The game as a whole takes a darker tone than the original and the pacing starts off slow, but ramps up around the halfway point once you start realizing the truth behind this world. It doesn\u2019t go completely overboard either \u2013 in fact, it might actually be a bit too slow. Perhaps this is just because the game is longer (this one took me just over 30 hours whereas the first took just 20), but I felt like they could have shaved off a bit towards the end to make it flow better.Still an interesting story for sure (and definitely better than the first game), but not quite at the level that I would call it anything more than just \u201cgood\u201d.I am a huge fan of the urban fantasy magical girl aesthetic and Second Light only expands on the first game in this regard with the improved world detail and upgraded visuals that bring it more in line with the recent Atelier games. It\u2019s definitely not a shining example as far as actual graphical quality, but the setting, character designs, and overall theme are solid. The music on the other hand, while still good, I did not find to be quite as good as the first game.The first game somehow used 100% of my RTX 3080 Ti even with the fps capped to my monitor\u2019s refresh rate, but this one ran just fine at 155 fps without turning my computer into a jet engine. There are far more graphical options to change this time too, so there is ample room to finetune settings if you need to.One recommendation I will make \u2013 do disable the game\u2019s depth of field setting, it is WAY more aggressive than it needs to be. Otherwise, the only other problems I had were with the game always launching in windowed (which you can solve by hitting F9) and a game crash about two hours in. I didn\u2019t lose much progress due to the new auto save feature, but any crash is worth mentioning.And surprisingly, the keyboard and mouse controls are actually NOT garbage this time around. There\u2019s actual mouse support in the menus, on the field, and it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s just emulating a controller. I still used a controller myself, but it\u2019s one of the few Koei Tecmo PC ports where the keyboard and mouse controls would be a viable alternative \u2013 I had no problems with them during my testing and they are rebindable too.Blue Reflection: Second Light is an overall improvement over the first game in almost every regard. A more fleshed out story, a bunch of useful quality of life features, much better visuals, vastly improved level design, a decent PC port \u2013 it\u2019s got a lot going for it. Unfortunately, the combat is a bit of a mess and the game is far too easy, making a lot of the new combat additions redundant. That, and while the story itself is interesting, it doesn\u2019t come without its problems. Still, I had a good time with it in spite of these faults and would recommend it if you like Gust JRPGs.Follow my  for more reviews + videos!",

                "text": "This game brought me lots of nostalgic feelings and moments of a particular summer holiday, that time when I was hanging around with a few friends and an older cousin, was such an unforgettable experience. We all thought perhaps the world held only us then.The central theme of this game is Cute-Girls-Doing-Cute-Things in an enclosed place, and the usual magical girls slaying evil spirits. The plot is very straightforward even though it seemed convoluted at first glance, of course, there are a few twists to make the story engaging but still very predictable. However, the pacing execution is the key to make even a predictable feels enjoyable.Overall, the game has a clear goal set up since the beginning (one of foremost problems that its predecessor failed to establish)I don't really have anything to say about Graphics aspect. Art style embraced the first game's and improved even more, the result is a beautifully-crafted game. You can also tinker around the Photo Mode feature and publish pretty pictures.However, there are some small texture bugs with characters' hair.The Localization part is a massive step up from the first game, Gust and KT did a great job of getting a top quality localization team for this game.And about the Port, perhaps the best yet. This game came with a fully mapped KB&M buttons - which is a huge plus from me. The quality is very consistent, I have had not notice even the slightest drop in frames.I might be repeating myself countless times, but still, the gameplay is also a massive step up from its predecessor.They got rid of the old Speed Turn-based system in favor of an ATB-ish Turn-based, which offers more strategy approach and nullify cheesing to an extent. The Gear-escalating system blends very well into this aspect, although this can be repetitive for some people.And unlike the first game, your party won't fully healed after getting out of a fight and kept remain their HP through out expedition. Seems like a normalcy to JRPG games but it could threw some people (who came from the first game) off.Additionally, this game now has a Dating system. It isn't as well-crafted or impactful like Persona 5, but still a very nice cherry on top regardless. And through this, the chemistry of characters as well as some RPG elements is expanded upon so there is no harm in engaging with this aspect.Should you buy this game? Yes, you should experience this game for yourself, there are still stuffs that I haven't touched upon.You don't have to jump into its predecessor or watch Blue Reflection Ray anime (but should also consider them a try) to have a reason to play this game.Although, the game's quite expensive right now, maybe once it goes on sales you can consider getting this!Pros:+ Story, dialogues and pacing execution blended very well+ Engaging gameplay and strategically friendly+ Beautiful graphics, lighting and particles+ Localization and Port was handled carefullyCons:- There are some slight graphics bugs here and there- Gameplay can feel very repetitive and boring at times",

                "text": "Now that I've finished the game proper, all of the stuff I said previously still holds up, but here are some extra thoughts on the whole thing:Music: the new tracks are still phenomenal, though I really REALLY miss the multi-phase music for bosses, as that mechanic is entirely absent in this game.Battles: They're like Ryza, but with it's own flair. It's very fun, as are the infight battles seeing as they're very active and snappy. The latter half of the game does get steamroll-y as your damage can scale up really fast once you start stacking fragments and school/item buffs. Bosses feel really weak compared to the original in almost every respect though, as they lack all the pomp and circumstance and get quickly recycled making them feel even less special.Story: I quite loved it, I thought I knew how the whole thing was going to pan out when reaching the back half but they did throw a few wrenches in there to shake it up. It's about as bittersweet as you'd expect.Characters: Each individual character story varied in depth, ranging from 'I've seen this a million times' to 'jesus, this is not daijobu' but each character does get mountains of additional fluff from the dates and chatter you see throughout the whole game to round them out. They really grow on you, and I got attached to every one of them, unlike the original game. I did often found myself just running around and cutting grass while thinking about what was going on in each of their heartscapes.Presentation: I absolutely loved the abstract designs for the heartscapes. Framing for the cutscenes, along with the music and overdone post processing (nuclear sun anyone?) gave it quite the unique look overall and suited the otherworldly vibe they were going for.As for some of the things that straight up sucked:- the stealth mission stuff just blows in every regard, thankfully there's only one or two instances where it's forced early on, with the rest of them being relegated to side missions you can take (or skip). Save scumming highly recommended if you do do those missions.- the back half of the game had some very obvious problems with proofreading, punctuation, and grammar compared to the relatively pristine first half.- the bosses paled in comparison to the og blue reflection, just full stop.Final thoughts: Second Light is a fantastic sequel, and anyone who likes slice of life style JRPG stories should absolutely give this a look (and the first one, also very very good).---Old Review---This is probably one of Koei's best PC ports to date. Looks great and runs great compared to the first game.As for the game, it's built off the original wonderfully along with adding a bunch of new systems that add a lot of flavor and character to the game. The soundtrack continues to be all 10/10 tracks, battling is a lot of fun, and the environments are very pretty and well detailed. The character design is also very nice, continuing the trend of cute girls doing cute things with each other. Honestly, it's met my expectations and more, can't complain at all.",

                "text": "Wholesome yuri dating sim jrpg with a splash of existentialism and an incredible soundtrack. I would highly recommend playing the first game prior to this one, as it is a direct sequel and some characters/story moments will be lost on you if you decide to skip it.There's a ton of optional content in the form of cutscenes, conversations, bonding systems and side quests. These are the meat of the game. If you have no interest spending hours watching slice of life cutscenes and doing errands to build your character bonds, this is not the game for you. The main story works as melancholic popcorn candy on its own, but if you spend the time to learn about the characters and their relationships, it can become something magical.Combat is flashy fun with just enough depth to be interesting, but it gets too easy halfway through and harder difficulties are locked behind beating the game. The 1v1 cut-in fights are pretty cool when they work though.Graphically the game is gorgeous, but has a fair amount of minor bugs accompanying it (mostly clipping). The models can look a little strange at times, but they really work well when they're being used as a catalyst to portray specific emotions.OST is phenomenal. It uses quite a few of tracks from the original, but has a large new selection as well. While the boss/combat themes are a step down, the area music is breathtaking. Each area's story, visual design, and soundtrack melt together in an incredible way and immediately set the tone seconds after you step into a new zone.Tl;dr:If you enjoy spending hours learning about characters and watching them interact while listening to some beautiful music, you'll probably like this game. If you get bored easily, dislike reading, or want to play it for the combat, you probably won't like this game.",

It's almost hard to believe that a game this good is at all related to the hot mess that was the original Blue Reflection.If, like me, you were drawn to the premise of the original game but ended up disappointed by it's poor writing, shallow characters and weak gameplay, then you will likely find Second Light to be everything you wished the first game had been and more.  As for newcomers to the series, while Second Light is a mostly self-contained story, I'd recommend watching the Blue Reflection Ray anime before playing it so you can get added context for the backstories of three of the game's characters. I wouldn't bother with the first game though, it's really not worth your time.In my opinion, Second Light is an absolute must-play for anyone who has ever considered themselves a fan of GUST's games, as well as fans of Yuri and the Magical Girl genre. It's easily one of the best games GUST has released in the last 10 years, and it has turned out to be my undisputed game of the year for 2021.",

So let me just say this: I don't buy RPGs because I give up on them all the time. After a few chapters of this, I realized that I needed to clear the game simply because I was LOSING SLEEP thinking about what was going to happen. At a certain point. I wanted to stop playing simply because I felt like it would hurt me to finish it. I didn't want it to end. But I was so bound to the story that I felt like I'd be letting the team down if I thought like that. I think if you play it, you'll understand what I mean. Anyway, I'm a fan now.

                "text": "I have finished the game unlike most other reviews at this time. I assume you've seen the anime and/or at least know all the characters that appear in this game.TLDR: General improvement from first game but some subjective weak aspects.As a KT game with cosmetic DLC, I think even just the base game is very overpriced in my currency.I was apprehensive about having characters from the anime in the game, but they gave them enough development and backstory to justify it. That said, I don't feel that all the characters got fair development - stories and traumas from characters like Kokoro, Shiho and Kirara are absolutely forgettable, while other characters have very appealing and emotionally strong backstories, such as Rena and Yuki. I picked Uta for my ending cutscene but was unfortunately let down since her story felt kind of tacked on to the game and I was hoping to get some proper closure on her, which I unfortunately did not. It's a weak way of putting it but I'd say characters overall are 6/10s with some 8s.There are a handful of translation/spelling issues, and I was wondering whether different teams handled different aspects of the text since different things seemed to share separate consistency at times. Nothing worth complaining about overall though.Story was fine, it ties in a little with the first game but neither first game nor anime is entirely necessary to see. I think the premise was fine but the execution was kind of lacking, although I'd expect that from a game that's more focused on character building that story. Without going into spoiler territory, I'd just call it solid. The overall plot is often put to the side in lieu of the character stuff anyway.I thought I wouldn't like it based on the demo because the pause mechanics during battle are different (if you have it set to \"manual\", you can forget to tell your allies to make their moves). However as expected I got used to it very quickly and I think I prefer the faster pace. Knockdown has more impact here than in the first game, as does the fragment system and the talent system. Overall, battle system is a major improvement - it has been heavily streamlined and is more engaging, with a better Ether system. Even after finishing I'm still on the fence about the one-on-one system, it's nice but sometimes messed up my flow, especially since some enemies can trigger it on their own.Stealth was the main thing I disliked, there are some very annoying stealth missions (Uta, Yuzu/Lime) that I ended up save-scumming. Enemy detection is wonky (can sometimes see through objects or at strange angles) and their vision indicator is misleading (you can stand in the \"weaker red\" parts and not get seen). Was just frustrating at times being sent back to the start by what felt like unfair detection.I also don't particularly like the crafting/building loop, more than a few times I found myself going back to farm more \"Warm Sand\" to make and upgrade furnishings. There are 50 crafting teams by the end, which is too many, but I mostly ignored items throughout the game anyway. That said, I also feel that you can mostly ignore this stuff since you just need to do enough to trigger dates, no need to go for the extra bonuses from upgrades. The base difficulty (normal) doesn't warrant this, by about midgame you should be streamrolling all content until the end of the game without much investment into furniture.The final boss fight is very nice however I would still say that Daath is very slightly better overall. It was sort of introduced from nowhere and had little relation to the story other than being there because it needed to be (no explanation for it etc.) There are no game/save breaking bugs like the first game. Unfortunately there are also no real extras for finishing the game other than a quasi-NG+. The ending is purposefully ambiguous so again if you were hoping for particular character story tie-ups you won't get them.The music is very good, I'd say about on par with the first game for some tracks, while others were unremarkable. I couldn't pick between first or second for area themes, but boss themes from the first are probably slightly better (DNF FW15C III or Sayonara is still the best one imo). Interesting choice to sample the voice recording from  but strangely I grew to like it. Tie uses music from the first game anyway (bar the boss themes). There was one moment where I was really hoping that they would play  but they played some funny light-hearted track which as Ao might say \"killed the vibe\". Generally good job by Hayato Asano once more.Standard Blue Reflection art, it's fine. If you liked it already it's pretty much the same. Personally felt that Uta/Mio/Hiori looked kind of strange in the proper artstyle but let's be honest the anime didn't do them justice either. You know how that went.=Overall was okay but as it is a KT game I cannot in good faith recommend buying it.",

Framerate is uncapped by default (take notes non-gust KT and Atlus) (Although VSync is always enabled), and there's a config file tweak that you can do to get ultrawide working (Albeit with stretched UI elements, otherwise works fine).Performance looks about the same, if not a bit worse than Atelier Ryza 2, BUT for anyone using a controller (or at least those using a DualSense controller), there is some massive framerate spikes and stutter that happens when you simply use a controller. This could be because of Proton, but otherwise, I haven't had many issues running it in Proton either. Just a heads up to keep in mind.Why none of the pre-release reviews by PC oriented sites didn't cover any of this stuff, especially when KT and other JP developers (that aren't Capcom or Square Enix) get away with murder without any sort of criticism (Figuratively speaking for those who don't get sarcasm), is beyond me.That said, while Mel Kishida is dangerously based, as of late, he's a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665-cat for pandering to braindead game journalists that whine about anything anyways, and reducing any sort of fanservice down to DLC items (like what KT tried with Dead or Alive and failed to appease any sexpest in the making) doesn't give anyone any faith. So buy this knowing that game journalists and snoy may have possibly ruined another game series, if my thoughts on the game outside of the port are to be believed.",

The first game had a very heartwarming and a little bit sad story and it shines with one of the best OSTs inside the gaming industry. I cannot say anything about the story in \"Second Light\" yet, but the music is incredible peaceful-melancholic, it is quite soothing.Yeah, it is a GUST game. That means, u have a bunch of very cute girls again and a lot of fans are \"men of culture\", I want to be honest with that. But \"Blue Reflection\" was special to me because of the little tragedy behind the main story and that's why it's not a \"fan service\" game in my sight like, for example, Atelier Ryza.GUST games are mostly very good games which are rich with content and Im looking forward to \"Second Light\" for being a worthy sequel.Til to this point, I will recommend this game. For the music at least.To make a point about what I mean with \"beautiful OST\", here is the incredible menu screen track of the first game which just dumbfounded me in the first second of hearing: Sry Blue Reflection, but I cannot recommend you anymore. Maybe it is better if you didn't play the first game. But I played the first game and I recognize the crazy amount of reused assets from the prequel, it hurts. And things which are new will get reused a lot of time as well. I am speaking from mobs, textures and objects here.The whole \"school make over\" thing isn't that great as well. To be able to put random stuff on random spots without any chemistry with the environment won't look great at all. You can place a freaking piano outside. A P - I - A - N - O !Outside!And the story and the world isn't mine as well. That is a matter of taste, yes, but loved the REAL school from the first game. With all of its pupils with their slice-of-life problems, I really liked it. Here we just have a little world, a little parallel universe with a little bunch of girls, well written, yes, but... It is not the same thing from the first game.But ok. I will do the last chapter now and call it a day.The ending is good though. But it cannot compete with its prequel. Sry about that.",

It's not perfect, and admittedly, the last 10% of the game starts to fall apart through the narrative and its gameplay. In fact, this series could still use some improvements for future titles if they decide to make a third entry. But the fact of the matter is, they addressed a lot of my issues with the first game to make it an enjoyable experience. The characters are really fun, there's actually a proper level up system, and the school building/item crafting system is an absolute joy to tinker with. As someone who didn't like the first game all that much, I'm glad I gave the sequel a shot and wholeheartedly recommend it if you're still on fence.",

The cast is all very likable and you feel like you get to know them really well over the course of the game. Ao is also an excellent protagonist. The RPG system is generally good though the game's biggest flaw is simply that it's too easy if you are keeping up with the optional content. Of course, it has the usual foibles of a Gust game, like limited character animations and some other obvious budget decisions, and it's a slow paced game with most of the appeal being the slice of life interactions with the characters. But if that's the sort of thing that appeals to you like it does me, I highly recommend it.",

So this is a provisional review.I did not get the 1st game because I read the Manga, which was great, watched some of the Anime which was crap and Nothing like the Manga.So I watched a trusted Youtuber's review and, well, didn't bother at the price it was. No way was I paying that for a faulty game.This one is way above that one so far. I have very much enjoyed it. The Characters are beautifully done as is everything else, and the fights are great fun. The story is very good and along the lines of the manga story.I also like the way they add in ways to add bonus skills and traits. The Obvious one of Support Characters but also by adding buildings to the school.The music, of course, is great to. I do hope this game carries on delivering.The One issue I have come across is when I selected to build 2 items when I only had enough for 1 and I could not go back, it just sat there and nothing would move me. I feel this is either the script hanging or a fault with the PC port. But the Right Click works everywhere else for going back, even in creating, so I have a feeling it was a script error. That was the only time I have had to crash the game.The other thing I liked is the Japanese voice acting. The cute voices were not to loud like in some games and Visual novels. The English text has been spot on so far, unlike game one.So far, based on what I have seen and enjoyed, I Recommend This Game. I am having alot of fun so why not you ?",

Nothing particularly \"wrong\" with the first game, mind you, but it was too easy and you pretty much could use the same skills all the time and here the combat is sort of ATB (Active Time Battle), where you have to choose when to use skills in real time but when selecting them you can take your time. Things are battle explained about what they do and you have more dynamic angles to make the battles more engaging. is another way I would choose to describe the Blue Reflection franchise and not in a boring way but truly relaxing. You can play for a long time having a great time without feeling burned out. have come to the sequel and they are all welcome. There is a synthesis mechanic here, which you may find simple if you are an Atelier fan veteran but it is fun nonetheless and very welcome. There are even more \"town development\" mechanics which I haven't got to the point of using yet. moves at a much more interesting pace compared to the first one. In this different world your character sees herself in you begin at day 3, which was a good move because you can make things go faster and when necessary there are small flashbacks to give a bit a context. is beautiful, just like the first game. Of course I will have to listen to more of it but I can already say I very much enjoy the battle music. Maybe not as much as the first game but I have that in such high regards (and much more time listening to it) that it's hard to beat. I can surely recommend Blue Reflection: Second Light even with little time played. If you played the first game rest assured this one already seems better in every aspect and in case you are a fan of JRPGs but are not familiar with the developer Gust (also known for the Atelier franchise) I advice you to give this game a chance.",

Once per Battle wastes a lot of time. you can disable them completely too-there are no costume unlocks except for the school swimsuit early on. the rest are dlc or from the deluxe/ultimate editions. there are no costumes for the Reflector outfits unfortunately. you only get to see those in battle-best girl is Hiori followed by Hinako",

Gust tried to capitalize on the success of Atelier Ryza by featuring a similar protagonist, but it just doesn't work in a Blue Reflection context. The prequel had a fully realized protagonist in Hinako, with real motivations and fears. Ao is just a vapid, lazy, under-charming everywoman, who is outshined by a significant portion of the cast. This may sound alright in an ensemble cast format, but when the protagonist has to participate in every one of the many, many cutscenes, her one-dimensional nature leaves a lot to be desired. The plot is urgent and directionless. Without a main villain, the girls are simply in a race against time. Not one of them has a clear idea of how to prevent their impending doom, or how to plan more than one step ahead.The battles uses Ryza's semi real-time system as a foundation, and heaps a mess of different ideas on top of that. It will take a little time to feel comfortable, but it does afford the player some flexibility to play the game more like a turn-based RPG, or more like an auto-battler.The bosses are very frail and uninspired things, who sit around waiting for you to approach them. Ao and her friends have no problem going mano a mano with these pathetic creatures, mere shadows of the lumbering monstrosities of BR 1 that required an entire army of high schoolers to take down.Everything else this game tries to flesh out is equally ill-conceived. The Reflector costumes don't quite work. The world is much larger and more ambitious, but somehow lacks the same atmosphere. The music just doesn't grab you. It's not necessarily bad, but in a game where battles usually take under a minute, you cannot include tracks that take that long to make a point. At the end of the day, this is a game with twice the play length and content of its predecessor, and still retains enough of the series essence for me to give it a recommendation. While I am a bit disappointed at the direction Blue Reflection is going in, a game must ultimately be judged by it's own merits, and you could do worse than picking up this title.",

I didn't play too much yet, but now we have a new protagonist, Ao Hoshizaki, a girl who feels her life has no sense, has no goals, and suddenly awakens in a empty school with no one except by other three girls she doesn't met before.I love how Gust complements the story with a scenario of hot summer, cicade and bird sounds, sunflowers, very typical in some slice-of-life animes.And, of course, lots..... tons of fanservice!! ;-) The girls are too cute, with different personalities.Graphically beautiful, I'm happy Gust improved their programming techniques for their games. IMHO, I recommend disabling the DOF, the game looks even better that way, I did it in Atelier Ryza 2 too.Totally recommended!EDIT: Now I finished the game TWICE just to get the true ending. Ok, it only adds about 30 seconds to the final cutscene, but I just couldn't stay in that cliffhanger and leave Ao in that time loop over and over.... so I played the 2nd playthrough to get sure that Ao finally managed to break the loop and finally reunite with her best friend, Kokoro in a happy new reconstructed world. I think I get why Gust made us to play all the game again in order to feel the same loop as Ao, and finally being able to break the loop, but playing it again with almost exactly the same content and get just 30 extra seconds, was a bit too much :sigh: ... Well, at least we got a happy true ending. I think I'm okay with that.",

Maybe this is a niche for certain fans who have been following this game but as a new comer, this is a hard no for me.",

The combat is also a lot more fun and complex. However normal is essentially easy mode, go for hard if you want some kind of challenge.A few cons however are the pretty bare bones dungeons, not much in the way of puzzles to break apart the monotony of combat and not much to explore. though they all are unique in their design. also they want you to back track through them a lot near the end and unlike say persona where the lower enemies are afraid and run away from you, all enemies will hunt you down and it can get annoying when you're forced into constant fights with one hit enemies. also be prepared to see the transformation scenes a lot! They do only happen once during a heartscape or during a boss fight, but again through multiple backtracking you will end up seeing them a lot. Unskippable but are only a few seconds, still got on my nerves. And the worst of all is the garbage stealth mission. They are only a few and the majority are tolerable. But near the end, they get just annoying. It really felt like the game was wasting my time while i had to wait for enemies to finally turn around or have weird sight where i wasn't sure whether i was in their line or not. Despite my cons, this is a good game for the smaller budget and i enjoyed my time with it. The characters, music, story are all quite good and i do recommend it, especially if you enjoy yuri",

                "text": "Are you here for gameplay? Better look somewhere else. Otherwise, look closer. Provided you don't mind lesbians. I hope you don't.Blue Reflection 2 (or Second Light) can be played without playing the first game, or watching the (not very good) anime. There are recurring characters and themes from both, but I'd say in case of the anime it's probably better to not know it. Has a good enough chance to make you dislike the characters coming from it, because it's not well written. The first game I can't just recommend due to a lot of issues thanks to its non existing budget. If you liked this game, you could still check it out later.What about the DLC? Ignore. So far nothing worthwhile has been released. The DLC area has barely any story/cutscenes, and for that we are here.So, what's this about anyway? A bunch of girls, with more and more appearing, trying to survive in a strange little world they are imprisoned in. Outside of the protagonist, Ao, none seem to have any memories. You play through their so called heartscapes, to see their most precious memories and help them to restore their memories. These memories made out of fragments of a key event of their lives, usually involving hard times that made them able to become what they are today. They are generally kept believable and on the ground, so it's a refreshing and relatively calm experience. The music nicely underlines this with a lot of nice and calm music with some electronic aspects to otherwise often piano music. Pretty good music, mind you. You may also get a little teary eyed here and there, but it's never too heavy on its mood.Aside of that, you get to know the characters better. Everything really has story meaning in the game. Building facilities for your place or fulfilling quests character give you, don't just give you gameplay benefits, they also grant \"date\" events, giving you a closer look at the character(s) in question. Raise their ranks through both, and you get further events with them. There's not much romance, mind you, though one very explicit lesbian couple exists, but that doesn't concern Ao. She can play wingman though... and still hold hands with the involved girls. Okay, it's weird, but that's just Ao. You can make her flirt pretty hard with any girl, really. If you like that, great. If you don't, there's usually an option to not do so, but it may be hard. Ao is just that much of a huge flirt. You do these things usually at the beginning of a chapter and it can take 2 or 3 hours. During dates you can often also find optional events (marked on your map), which is a nice touch, aside of some obligatory choices slightly changing dialogue. Eventually you'll go into the next dungeon, and here we get to the less great part. The nice part of them is, that you can find the fragments and get enough little cutscenes to entertain. The not so nice part is, gameplay.Dungeons. Gameplay. Well, it's an Rpg, right? Right. First of all, if you aren't willing to use cheat engine to get the difficulty up to hard, or as of v1.01 deathwish, you can stop reading after this paragraph. It's so easy, you don't need to know if the mechanics are for you. It's gonna be boring, but you can dodge a lot of enemies in dungeons. There are also some stealth missions, where some later ones might frustrate. You can however save ANYWHERE in a dungeon, and pop right back to where you were, making it ultimately never more than a minor test of patience. Now then, you have cheat engine ready? Higher difficulties actually require that you really make sure to upgrade facilities and care about what skills you learn. (hint: Don't touch the flat stat ups, like attack + 3, and get the Yuki ether boost skills ASAP) That said, once you hit a certain point of the game, even deathwish becomes easy mode. In new game+ it should be easy mode from the get go. (the point you'd normally have it unlocked for) Because battle performance really matters little, I won't write much about the battle mechanics. Just one thing: Basically every fight is the same, which I consider a big minus. Some mechanics are also rather counter-intuitive (1vs1 is just a BAD mechanic, no matter how you look at it), and nothing is even remotely strong enough to live till you can use your \"ultimates\", especially given that enemies love to kill themselves due to triggering 1vs1. The endgame is also particularly stretchy, getting in the way of the story climax. Really, it's not great. Can be fun for a bit, but eventually you just cruise, as if it's normal mode.Still though, it's a good game, if you like cutscenes and getting to know a big cast that's well used and doesn't even really suffer from the \"everyone has to say one line per cutscene\" syndrome. Unfortunately there's also some bad news. The translation is a professional 4/10. While each line by itself is mostly correct, , in context there are way too many moments where the word choices do not make sense or downright clash with lines just seconds before. Being a liberal translation is fine and all, but then you need to pay a lot more attention to context, which they really didn't. The translation also likes way too much to write out what was originally only implied. If you played the first game, it's very similar to that. While it's a shame that the translation is so sub-par, there's still a lot you can enjoy. For a commercial product that relies heavily on its text, the translation may be disappointing. But there's way worse out there. This was simply a game that required more attention to detail, which it did unfortunately not get.",

Here, you will be building memories with both new and old friends. Even if you have no prior experience with the series, the game provides you with enough backstory to ensure that you don't miss out on the most heartfelt moments.Production values have been vastly improved this time. Character movement has enough weight that we don't feel like we are just floating around. The visuals are consistent, and at times breathtakingly beautiful. Mise-en-sc\u00e8ne resembling contemporary art films from the first game is still present here. Both party members and NPCs move around the school and do various activities on their own such as watering plants or eating takoyaki. It's quite endearing at times just watching what they do.Bonding events are plentiful and a lot more interesting. As a matter of fact, I haven't come across any bonding event that feels trivial enough to skip - even though the temptation can be high as the main plot gets intriguing. One might say that there are simply \"too many\" of them, which can get exhausting. Also worth noting is that there are a lot less incongruous fan service scenes this time.Unfortunately, the game is not without elements that can compromise enjoyment. First and foremost - the stealth missions. I know they are optional, but the completionist in me tells me otherwise, and so does the character who has lost her phone and needs my help sneaking past densely packed enemy hordes to retrieve it. Enemy movement appears to be completely random, and the camera often prevents us from being able to see whether it's safe to move forward or not. This, combined with exhaustion from monotonous battles and a few uninteresting maps, makes the game fall short from being my favorite Gust produced game.Regardless of some annoyances, the game is, after all, an amazing experience with its excellent story and lovable characters.",

An engaging, modern soundtrack and good voice acting for icing.Not sure this can be recommended for lower end gaming PCs. Visually: art but not without technical blemishes, and cloth + hair physics come across as a little broken (even mid/upper rigs).Game systems are well integrated (they support each other) my only gripe being I'd play happier if they went easier on the signposting (or just let me turn off some of it)There is enough content to justify a 2nd run unless you doggedly grind and unlock every upgrade at every chapter on first play (in which case you're spoiling the RPG/combat experience cause it will be too easy).Isekai/yuri/slice of life/magical girl fans will be delighted; likewise: have a good time if an all-girls cast is not off-putting, and you JRPGs but usually feel they are too grindy.Striving for objectivity, I'd say Second Light has evolved, and here is now a better game. Still, I recommend Blue Reflection (first game) as the ultimate magical girl experience; can understand newcomers may skip the first issue, but they'll definitely be missing out.",

Ridiculous, I know, but a recurring problem in previous KT games; Tested in a RTX 3060, game still doesn't utilize 100% GPU and doesn't run at 144 fps, but now at around 110~120 all the timeVery cute, chill and interesting game. Combat is a little confusing at first, but gets fun real fast. Visuals, specially the environment and character models are gorgeous, I'd say way better than most anime games I've played (although there wasn't many). I guess some people would think the story is a bit bland or shallow, but so far I'm very interested in what's going to happen next, not to mention I like all the characters so far.Performance is a little weird at the moment. Game runs fine @ 60 fps most of the time, but drops to 50s, 40s and even 30s at the most random occasions like a close up on a character's face in a cutscene, while maintaining solid 60 fps while in battle or exploring a large area. GPU utilization also almost never really exceeds 80% even when running at 30something fps, so I imagine there's some underlying issue at the moment that may get fixed at some point. This is running @ 1080p, mostly medium and high settings (didn't see much of a performance difference on low, but the game looks a lot worse), on a GTX 1650 and i5 11400F with 16GB ram, so keep that in mind when buying the game. That being said though I barely notice when there are frame drops, mostly because of the somewhat \"slow\"-paced gameplay (it's a good thing), so it doesn't bother me at all so far.Turning anti-aliasing ON in the game's settings make everything a little blurrier for me for some reason. Turning it off and then turning FXAA on inside nvidia's control panel made a whole lot of difference.Haven't played the first one (but do plan on doing so) so can't compare them.",

The original game had some serious pacing issues by gating you with padding and any menial sidequests with not much pay off other than earning enough points to unlock the next main story quest. BLUE REFLECTION: Second Light quickly found its footing. There are still hunting quests, stealth missions, etc BUT this time you are rewarded for your time helping your friends by getting talent points and levels, new scenes and more chances to take your friends out on dates. It's not your typical JRPG. The pacing here will be a bit different due to BLUE REFLECTION's focus on intimate character interactions. In this game, in order to unlock new talents, its important to spend time and bond with your friends. By building relationships, your party grows stronger. This game is very cutscene heavy, but please stick with it. The character interactions are great and are the big highlight of the magical girl genre.Gameplay: 8/10The questing can be a bit mindnumbing, but the rewards and the battle system keep it interesting and fun. I am close to 20 hours in and I am still enjoying tweaking with my character builds and trying different teams. You will eventually unlock fragments which grant you skills and bonuses that you can equip to each character. Do not neglect these as they are extremely useful. They can be earned by going on dates with friends.Graphics 8/10This is not a graphically intensive game, but they have really stylized it and made it their own so it still looks gorgeous. Their use of colors and effects for transformations are flashy and fun. I really don't mind the repetitiveness of the transformation animations since its a key aspect of any magical girl show :DStory 8/10The story is definitely not for everyone, but I found personally found it engaging. I found myself getting very excited when a new zone opened up so I could learn more about each character. This is an extremely character driven narrative and the interactions between Ao and her friends are the highlight of this adventure. I am not giving a summary because it can get spoilery quick, but if you really enjoy deep, personal narratives with slice of life aspects, give this a shot!Music 9/10The battle music is fast paced and fun. Each zone's music is heavily stylized to the theme and I really loved all the different effects that they used. It may not be for everyone, but I always feel like Gust nails their OSTs.Overall 8/10 I am so far really loving BLUE REFLECTION: Second Light. If you are on the edge of the water, just dive right in. I think Ao and her friends will make it worth your while!",

                "text": "is a solid story driven split screen co-op experience that plays more like an interactive movie for a large majority of the game. This however doesn't take away from the brilliant narrative displayed by it's main characters Vincent and Leo or the immense amount of fun to be had within this awesome game.I originally played through  not long after it's initial release on the Origin client (my only actual purchase on EA's Origin service to date) with a close friend and decided upon a recent sale to pick the game up again on the Steam client in order to play through it again with the same friend but this time swapping the characters we played with on the first playthrough.While the entire game is great, I believe this game really does shine for it's mini-games. Spending a large majority of the time played enjoying games such Connect 4, Grenade Brothers, Baseball and a variety of others.Through many plot twists and turns,  truly does stand out among other games for it's incredible story and is well worth looking into if you have a good friend to play it with.If I were to list any downside to the game, it would be it's unskippable cutscenes (even after you've finished the game multiple times), a lack of ability to injure/kill friendlies (not counting letting enemies kill your friend) and perhaps a bit too much in the way of locked combat/animation. Aside from those and the fact that my Steam achievements were instantly unlocked due to it binding with Origin achievements (I already had them all), I don't have many complaints for this game and I would happily play through it again in the near future.",

                "text": "is a heavily story-driven action-adventure game that tells the story of two convicts,  and . The catch is that the game is playable only in co-op. The game supports both local and online options, and you can use  to stream it to your friend, or you can use  on , where your friend just needs to download the game files, and you will invite him to your lobby. You can also play with random people online, but you cannot play it alone.The whole game feels like a good action film with several interesting plot twists. The story itself starts in a prison where both  and  ended up because of a guy called . As their path crossed during a few incidents, they decided to work together, escape the prison, and find . Both characters are unique in their own way as  is more of a guy who first acts rather than thinks, and  is the exact opposite of him, which leads to several humorous and a bit unpredictable situations. I would say that their personality is interesting and likable, as I was interested in their problems and related side characters, like family members. On the opposite, the villain  is just an uninteresting figure who does not have any depth at all, and the game would prosper from fleshing out his character more. There are also a few situations that do not make sense, and they break my immersion a bit. For example, if a character has another person as a human shield, its weapon\u2019s ammo is unlimited, and he does not reload it at all. However, even with all these problems, I enjoyed the story, as  and  journey was thrilling and emotional. In the end, I will remember some story twists for a while.I highly recommend playing this game with your partner, friend, or another relative, as it adds a lot to the experience rather than with random people. The game lasts about , and I would say that the length is just right. I could probably argue that one more hour could help flesh out some characters, but it would still be quite short. Most of the time, you have to go through small open locations and finish the task to continue to another section. One of the most used gameplay mechanics are quick-timed events, which are surprisingly done right, and there is no tremendous button mashing, so that is a plus. However, do not expect some complex gameplay or mechanics. This game relies on quick-timed events and short different elements. The gameplay is tailored to fit the story, you will not find here difficult puzzles as in  series or more complex combat options as in  series. The game is very forgiving, and the checkpoints are very common.Throughout the chapters, the game changes the environment, tasks, and gameplay activities a lot. The co-operation of both players is very important as you cannot finish the game without it. There are a lot of easy environmental puzzles that fit the narrative and linearity of the game, but I would still wish for at least a few more complex tasks. Sometimes the game lets you deal out with enemies via stealth or shooting. Unfortunately, AI is quite stupid, so you can rush through the area quickly and knock them out. As for shooting, the gunplay is quite good but a bit easy, as well. However, sections, where you drive vehicles, are a bit harder as you mostly fight the camera (this, especially, applies to the bikes). I would welcome some difficulty settings, at least for the enemies. If you are looking for a challenging co-op experience, then you will not find it here.The game also offers various activities and minigames, which are only present in specific chapters. For example, you can throw darts, play videogames, interact with others, and much more. I am not going to name them all, but it varies a lot throughout the chapters, and it keeps the game fresh and interesting. Even if you decide not to do them, you will still receive a fair amount of diverse gameplay.Sometimes the game offers you a choice to continue in certain situations differently. It changes cutscenes and gameplay a bit, so small replay value for at least one more playthrough is here. To put a clear picture, you might decide if you will try to cross the bridge with the police in a car, which is the fastest but more dangerous variant, or if you will go underneath the bridge. Speaking about choices, the game also has two endings, but none of the previous choices matters, as they are more about how do you continue your journey gameplay-wise rather than about longtime story effect. The thing I disliked about this mechanic is that both players have to actually choose the same option. If two players will not choose the same thing then you wait until one of you decides to side with the other player. The game should have implemented an RNG system that would choose in such situations.The second thing I did not like much about the gameplay is how the screen is split in half even in online co-op. I understand this is necessary for local co-op, but it is a bit irritating as your screen is smaller for the whole game. There were few occasions where the game actually let play only one player and the scenes transmitted rather than being cut in half. This option was way more enjoyable and film-like. It would probably also add a bit to the difficulty, as you would not have an option to look to your partner's side.The game looks great graphics-wise. It offers several beautiful sceneries and cutscenes which might be comparable to films. There are several animations for different situations, and they are properly fleshed out. The only minor issue is that you can drive through a few branches during car chases which destroys an immersion a bit, and I would not expect this in this linear short game. As for the sounds, the sound effects themselves are of high quality. As for the soundtrack, there are few compelling compositions, but nothing memorable. The game was tested with an , running at high settings at  frames per second, at  resolution. The game ran without any problems and crashes. However, the connection with  servers caused troubles a few times, as sometimes my partner got kicked, and I could not invite her again, as  did not show her in online status. For a short game like this, it is pretty annoying but, fortunately, the game has many save spots, so you can jump right back to where you ended.Even with the aforementioned shortcomings, I can still easily recommend this game, especially if it is on sale. It is an enjoyable, thrilling, and captivating story-driven experience, and I wish there would be more games like this.",

The camera design they have gone for is like something I've not seen before considering you can see your friends game and what they are doing, I thought that I would find it quite annoying but honestly after playing it for 30mins it doesn't even bother you and it actually quite a cool little design. Some of the transitions they have put in the game when the camera changes is amazing and very well done. This is also a game where once you have completed it you will want to play again to see the different outcome. I would 100% recommend this game if you have a mate to play with. The only bad thing about this game is it isn't that long and you can complete it in about 5 hours.",

                "text": "Summary: If you love Telltale games but always thought they'd be way more fun in co-op, then  is for you!This is a co-op only, narrative adventure game in which two prisoners team up to escape prison and extract revenge on a Big Bad Guy. Great fun if you're looking for a movie-esque gaming experience with a buddy and a beer. You can play local or online, but note that this game will require you to install and run the Origin launcher despite being on Steam. The upshot of this is that you only need to buy one copy of this game to play together -- even for online play (the other player can download and run the Origin Friend Pass to access the game without added cost.)There's lots of quick-time events that require that you time your key clicks with your friend and a bit of light stealth is required at points, but otherwise the game is quite linear so there's no room for creativity. You're just along for the story here. As such, the game is short and probably not going to be replayed unless you want to play with a different friend later. Still, really good for a one-off Friday night chill game.",

My brother and I played this together and we can both agree this has been one of the best co-op games we have ever played,  there also is tons of hidden items and mini-games to play and compete in with your partner that add a extra bit of immersion and keep you entertained while your partner is in a cut scene.  The camera work is amazing and the transitions between scenes is the best I've ever experienced, it makes you feel like you're in a 5-6 hour long movie which If I might add should be played in a singular session.  The story in this game is the only one I could imagine to come close Red Dead Redemption 2 and I can without a doubt say this will be one of those games that pull at your heart strings. With all the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 titles be churned out I implore you If you are reading this review whatever this price of this game is buy it and play with a good friend not some random you will both have a great time.",

Very unique camera implementation that works well with the main gimmick (working together) where the screen may split in half vertically/horizontally, 3-way split or simply a single screen depending on the situation. There are some great action sequences and cinematic scenes that are a blast to play through especially when you reach the hospital event. At times, both of you are given the option to select what action you want to take to proceed ahead which does alter the game for that one section. Only negatives would be the somewhat clunky controls and length of game (5-10 hrs).  I highly recommend this title to anyone that enjoys co-op games. [8.5/10]",

You only need a copy of this game.2. Your friend can download the free version (Friend Pass) - Playable only with someone owning this game.3. You must have an Origin Account linked to Steam. - Same goes with your friend.4. Open Game > Play Online > Invite Your Friend > Enjoy!5. More fun to be in discord with your friend.My friend and I played this game for 7 hours straight. It's like a cinematic action & thrilling movie wherein both of you are very much involved. Teamwork is a must. I love how each transition and cam was made to focus to each of us. They even put some mini games as an ice breaker. The game have different endings, of which, depends mainly on how the both of you play, the agility & stamina of your fingers and how your camaraderie was developed - in game and in real life. The ending will surely cut you deep. \ud83d\udda4",

Usually, massive story-driven games are only for single player and it's hard to share the kind of experience that these types of games give you. A Way Out, however, allows you to experience a massive story-driven game with a friend. Playing the two characters gives completely different perspectives on the story. The two characters often get separated and do unique things while still kind of connected. Playing a different character after finishing the game gives a completely different version of the game.All the levels are creative and use split-screen co-op's advantages to its best. The cinematic camera angles and changes of screen placements are pleasant and well designed. In the hospital level where the players take turns to controls their characters in full screen, the use of cinematic transitions and long camera shots are amazing. The different choices that the players can vote on could have some influence on how the game plays. These choices don't change anything major, but they make some parts of the levels different.The story of A Way Out is great and the endings are unexpected and emotional. The characters are pretty well made, and their emotions seem real. There are many mini-games scattered around the story for the players to compete with each other. Some of them are not well made, but it's always fun to mess around with a friend and have a little fun.At some later parts of the game, the characters get guns and start shooting people. The aiming is a bit weird, especially if you are playing with a controller. Those parts just feel like a cheaper and more boring version of Uncharted 4 without all the grappling hooks and moving around the environment.There is barely any game out there that targets split-screen co-op as a major selling point except for A Way Out. I highly recommend trying it out with a friend or family member. I hope there are more good co-op story-driven games like this in the future.",

                "text": "Even though the game's brilliant mechanics seem bluntly obvious in hindsight, A Way Out was kind of a revelation when I first started playing. Most co-op games I've experienced involved playing  to somebody else, where your respective lines rarely intersected in a significant way except during combat when you both happened to whack the same guy. A Way Out tangles up your lines and throws the two of you into sticky predicaments where you have to  together, and not just fight together. Communication and coordination are very important and you are just as dependent on your companion's poor timing as they are on your shoddy aiming. This results in some genuinely tense collaborative moments and a good amount of laughter (under which some quiet grumbling can be tucked away) when things don't pan out.Fortunately, the game is fairly easy as its main focus is the narrative and the interaction between the two protagonists. The story is the third protagonist by the way, and it provides the perfect premise for your synchronous shenanigans. But it also does so much more, as it is the main driving force behind the whole game, propelling your characters into one scruffy escapade after another. The puzzles and fights you encounter, while very light on gameplay, are woven cleverly into the narrative. Your mutual efforts feel practical as well as natural, and reinforce the two men's cooperation through your own blundering attempts at assisting one another. The sense of striving and failing together seeps from the real world to the game world, smudging your own feelings over your character's in a nebulous blend, and creating an incredibly immersive and convincing co-op experience.",

                "text": "A Way Out is a coop story driven game where two players work together to achieve their goal.This is exclusively a coop game, I have nothing against it but I think it should have a solo mode which shouldn't hurt and only would make it to sell better.The game plays in split-screen despite if you're playing local or online. There are some spoiler sensitive scenes I can't speak about where this didn't make any sense.The story is quite good, it comes from the developers of Brothers a Tale of Two Sons. There are two characters \u2013 Vincent and Leo. They meet in the prison and decide to break out of it for revenge.From the very beginning you need to learn to work together to bypass various situations and threats. While the game is mainly story driven I wouldn't call it a fully narrative experience. There's quite some gameplay there and it's pretty diverse. Mostly you'll be walking around or sneaking while figuring out how to get to where you need. Which isn't hard by the way, there are no real puzzles. But it has other gameplay mechanics like rowing the boat, driving and shooting. While all of these usually are very poorly executed in similar games, here they work well. Of course don't expect super deep driving physics or shooting mechanics but driving feels smooth, sometimes it feels like a proper racing game. And shooting is also decently done and isn't clunky at all, mostly it works as cover based shooter.Gameplay changes often and there's always something new so the game doesn't become boring or repetitive.You do stuff by pressing or tapping buttons, sometimes in perfect sync with another character, there are no moments when another character has nothing to do. There are sections when one character is more busy than the other but at these moments you still can explore the surroundings, speak with people or play some mini-games. There are mini-games for both players too. Oh and i encourage you to speak with people since that leads to some funny dialogues and little stories. On top of that there are easter eggs which are tied to achievements and roughly half of them are really fun to do because they lead to some short cut-scenes, mostly funny ones.In general gameplay is nearly perfect and has perfect amount of everything, calm moments of silence, talking, action, running and so on. It feels like a really long movie.Graphically the game looks good. Surroundings are beautifully crafted with lots of small details around and things to interact with while character models are good but could be better, it's nowhere near Man of Medan or Quantic Dream games. Although facial animations and expressions are quite good.Performance is perfect, game runs on max settings at 90-100fps easily, played on 5800x, 2070s, 32gb @3440x1440. There's ultrawide support but it's weird. Sometimes when there's a scene of only one character the image is in correct aspect ratio but smaller with black space around it. But there are some moments when the screen space is fully utilized so ultrawide works.Voice acting and sound are good too. Music feels like it's from a movie and plays along nicely with the mood of the scenes. Voice acting sometimes could be ok only but mostly it is good.Overall a very good coop story driven game with diverse gameplay, cool movie-like action scenes and dramatic moments. Definitely worth a buy. Not at full price though since the game is short and has no replayability value. Achievement hunting and another ending could net you an additional hour or so since it has chapter select but that's it.",

Worked flawlessly and we have had tons of laughter and fun. I even feel ashamed to have bought it on sale. Would've gladly payed full-price or even AAA.If you have someone reliable and regular to play it with, go ahead, there aren't many other options. If not that you might get lucky online, but maybe not. You can definately not play it alone and have fun...",

You are two inmates, one who just got incarcerated and another one who has been there for 6 months already. You quickly realise that you both ended up in prison because of a crime boss named Harvey and you decide to escape prison to take revenge on him.The prison is actually just a small part of the game, your adventure will go much farther than those walls! The characters will get to learn about each other and decide on what to do to reach their goal. The story is kinda typical but there are some twists that we personally didn't expect at all. In any case it was very enjoyable and we were completely immersed in it (you feel it when you or your partner is in danger!). The screen is split in two so you can both see what the other is doing and when something important is happening to one character then his screen will extend and cover the other one for a bit. The same thing will happen if there is a shared cutscene, but this time making the two screens fuse. This feels a little weird at the beginning, but you quickly get used to it and it's really nice to see what the other is up to, especially when you split up.The story is divided into scenes/chapters. You go to a place, you do this, then you move on to another scene. You can usually mess around in the scenes and they are big enough to not feel trapped. But it does feel sometimes that you are jumping from one to another a bit hastily.The two characters have very different personalities and will not react the same way to things or dialogues. One is reckless while the other is more cautious. Sometimes when choosing a way to pass an obstacle you'll have to choose which character's plan to follow. But it's also in the little things: when prompted a character will break the locked window while the other will try to find another way. The choices, even the little ones, really help with the immersion.There are several puzzles (ex: how to get this thing out of this room without the guards noticing). From what I have seen, there are always several ways to reach your goal.There are some action scenes too, where you need for example to run away from things. Again, we were really into it and trying hard to succeed. If you fail though (which happens rarely because the emphasis is clearly put on the story/adventure and not on the challenge), you will be brought back to a nearby checkpoint.There are lots of little things scattered through the levels to have fun with your partner. There are often silly things: cut the wood because... why not? Play a board game or darts with your partner and get the highest score. And as silly and useless as it sounds, we would always seek them out to try them, because they were actually fun. Little hidden things throughout the levels; like tell this to that person, play that game, get this score, do this silly thing... Nothing annoying. You can replay a specific level so it was really easy to go back and get them all after our playthrough.",

                "text": "Avoid at all costs, RF4 staff bans innocent players:The game has great potential, but RF4 staff members act abusive when facing criticism, it is well known that they abuse their power regarding forum activity. Yesterday, I reported a bug that remained unfixed although they were told about it before christmas events patches. The bug led to my reel being heavily damaged, thus leading further to a loss of silver due to a lack of interest in fixing that bug. I reported it. The tone was ferm, no offensive language has been used, I can prove it with screenshots. They deleted my report and gave me a warning for aggresive behaviour. They did not address the bug, they ignored it. I am a paying player, I invested in this game, I support their \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 attitude, so I won't take warnings from lazy devs. I wrote again in the criticism section (funny they have one, they are unable to take any kind of criticism). No offensive language, same ferm tone. Next thing, they issue an IP ban for my game account, not for my forum account. However, I am not the only RF4 player in my house, so 2 other players found themselves banned without doing anything. Game ban for forum criticism? Abusive, that is exactly what lazy game devs do. Are they lazy? Yup. They could easily find out that the two other players had other connections in the past, with different IPs and I was the only one to write and play from the same IP, constantly. Yet, they were too lazy to research that, resulting in a banning of innocent players. This is the end of RF4 for me, I will not support childish developers who had some unity tutorials on YT and believe they now own their game. They don't. Paying players do. I am not saying you should stop playing rf4, that is your choice. But I would be really careful where I invest my money, since RF4 has delivered nothing but bugs and aggressive attitude lately.",

                "text": "*UPDATE 2022 REVIEW AND GUIDE*The most common question asked below is why 2,000 hours? well I have now elapsed 4,000 hours across my accounts. So maybe the question I should have been asked is not would I refer this to my friends. To would I continue to play it more?And to that the answer is yes, despite all the  the game is very realistic it continues to add new maps and features and methods of fishing which push me to try new things. And one of the smartest fish AI in the world. When you have hooked a large fish and fought him for minutes or in many cases hours. the feeling up triumph is overwhelming.Overall Game play:First lets start with the most important. The game is very Grindy, Experience and level are easy to come by. However money and gear are much harder to acquire. Second lets talk about the realism. This is what keeps drawing me back. This game is the most realistic on the market. It is not just the graphics, it is how the fish fight, to wear and possible malfunction of your gear. It is such a challenge to chase a big fish down the stream knowing at anytime he could break your gear.Third is Mechanics. Mechanics are what is required to land a fish. Since shortly before Amber was released, was a mechanic implemented in the game. This mechanic causes the fish to nibble at your line setting off your alarm without taking the bait. You must be patient and watch for the rod to bend during a strike. However if you are currently engaged with another rod you may miss this exact time, and you are stuck reeling in a slack line. It is very easy to not catch fish because of this. It takes patience and experience in a already difficult game and even then you will miss a lot.Mechanics continued: because of the recent changed players are abandoning the game in droves. The developers seem to be more focused on the realism of there product than how it affects there player base.The mechanisms put into the game caused an increasing number of  When this happens in an already difficult game especially when fighting a large fish and without slack line the . Revenue: Every good game has a source of revenue. Competitors to this game must charge an initial fee or charge for download content. This Game Can be completely played Free 2 Play.This game source of revenue is premium and gold coins. Premium gives double experience as well as an increase chance of skill up %. Many will say you can actually set yourself back by buying premium at a low level. The theory is that you catch less fish per level, so less silver, and then you access maps which require heavier gear to fish. My own theory is different. While you absolutely should play this game for free if you can, If you do have the ability to buy premium it is to your advantage because; Every level you acquire more ability points. when placed in skills this can have a very great effect even increasing Trophy chances, also with the additional skill ups will decrease the grind considerably and allow access to higher rigs like PVA and Sand which baits sooner. If you do subscribe to premium please be careful to not over fish your gear, also in RF4 no matter premium or not there WILL come a day when you unlock a map you do not have the gear to fish. So fish with caution always.Gold coins are used for a variety of things, you can use it to purchase rods or reels. as well as there is bait some fish prefer which can be bought with gold coins or crafted.Hints & Tips:Dig! If you saw me fishing you would think this game was Russian Digging 4. A shovel costs 38 silver and can be acquired as early as level 3. Digging is a FREE (after you purchase the shovel) way of grinding up your bait harvesting. You will initially only dig up worms, but soon you will dig more and more baits. Eventually digging up Gold Baits which you would otherwise need to buy.Drink tea ?!? Ok 1st let me say this, there are many players in the game who almost never eat or drink. Your character can not die. One of my sources below has gone so far as to hide his stat bars with an overlay to make them look full because of the constant flow of people telling him to eat when he knew he did not need to. That said, Drinking Tea will make your energy rise faster. To Make tea you need a Packet of Tea from the grocery store, you need a tea kettle from the hardware store, and you need Firewood and matches also from the Hardware store.Hot Slot Coffee/Tea: You are given 5 action bars, I like to use my first 3 spots for my primary rods I am using. number 4 goes to my scoop/shovel and my 5th slot is coffee or tea. By hot slotting coffee/tea you can quickly drink it for an energy boost without needing to bring up the food menu, particularly important when fighting a big fish.Gear Advice:There are many ways to play this game, please play it your way. but this is my advice for maximum profitability. Buy 3 starter feeder kits from the tackle store (149 silver). These kits are well balanced and are a great value for a new player.Most players prefer to next move into a mid tier reel like the Caliber HSV or Narga. And while the Caliber HSV is the most popular pick I have seen a great many of them break! They have incredibly weak mechanisms. Kiltedjocks spread sheet below lists the Theoretical break points of reels and The caliber HSV lists as a maximum drag of 31.72 the Narga 8k is 44.6kg max drag. and even the cheaper Alfa 8k out performs the caliber hsv as the alfa's break point is 38.1 kg.The more you spend on mid tier reels and rods is up to you. As you really need to save for meta gear. This is just very grindy.Last Piece of advice: I myself was given poor advice on how to setup a rig. I should have known better. But I setup my rig faulty anyhow thinking on my poor advice. I nearly broke my rod, and I did near fatal damage to the blank (un-repairable).I was devastated. I took my time and hid in my embarrassment. But eventually I contacted rf4 support and calmly explained what I had done. RF4 was nice enough to repair my rod. This does not mean they will do it for you. They even told me this was a one time fix. If you have a problem contact supprt at Sources:I would not be able to be here giving this advice without having received so much knowledge from the following people. They have many more hours in the game than me. Please visit them drop a follow and say hi, then ask anything you want to know. They will gladly help you with rig advice, gear selection, they may know of a hot spot for you, and if they don't. Odds are someone in their chat does.Thank you so much for the Likes and Comments. And a special heart felt Thank You for the badges \ud83e\udd70",

                "text": "Ah, Russian Fishing 4.An amazing game, but yet one that i advice you as a player to stay away from even after having played it for nearly 700 hours myself. However, the reason may not be what you would immediately expect. So let us not get ahead of ourselves, and instead first examine the pros and cons of the game:Pros==========- Very realistic in most aspects. Probably the most realistic fishing simulator on the market at the moment- A long progression path that will keep you \"busy\" for a very long time (i did not reach the \"end game\", although i came close)- A large selection of gear and fishing specialization paths for you to work towards and explore- Pleasantly and beautifully made lake maps- Overall gives a feeling of actually fishing rather than playing a game- A highly complex system of variables to take into account when catching fish. Among them the standard weather, temperature and time but also things like line type, line size, leader size, attachment visibility, gear and tackle qualities, fish migration, bait preference changes and much moreThat all sounds great doesn't it? So why the negative review? Well, let us move on to the cons:Cons==========- In several instances, the lake progression path does not make sense. This will often leave new players frustrated with broken gear fishing at places they do not have the correct gear for yet or simply no or few fish- In several instances, the crafting progression does not make sense. In RF4 you learn to harvest baits as well as making groundbait and lures. However, often in those progressions what you learn does not match the actual lake/fish availability.- In several instances, the store stock system especially will leave new players frustrated. Every lake has a certain set of stores in which many items will say \"out of stock\". For most items that actually means \"will never be in stock\", but the game does not explain this. Furthermore, crafting requirements often need components from particular lakes that do not fit with general player progression. In some cases when the player finally reaches a \"checkpoint\" in crafting, they have passed the need for that craft in the first place.- Bugs. Although this is an early access game, there is a large list of bugs, many of which are not recognized by the game management even though every \"old\" player know that they are present. These bugs include (but are not limited to) chat lag, IDs appearing instead of player names, store lag, selling lag, ghost bites, strange \"fish got away\" streaks that sometimes do not make any sense at all and much moreSo those were the general pros and cons of the game. But wait, there is more to be said about the game. You see, the game includes a place called the \"penalty pond\" or popularly called the \"prison pond\". This place is a specific \"lake\" map players are sent to if they for some reason have a falling out with the management of the game. Having a \"falling out\" with the management can entail everything from what you normally see moderated in other games by a profanity filter to posting something on the forum or discord that is not the the general liking of the management.When you are sent to the prison pond, you will get a notification that you have to catch X amount of weight of fish to get out again. Mind you, the fish in the prison pond (i am told) are all small, so having to f ex catch 10 kilos of fish may very well take a very long time. Not exactly a fun prospect in a game which a player originally decides to play for just that - fun!The philosophy behind the prison pond isn't all that bad though in my opinion. However, you may suddenly find yourself on the receiving end of the stick for a supposed violation that you do not understand or agree with. And at this point you will have no choice but to bow down and catch your small penalty fish effectively wasting your time and metaphorically speaking agreeing that you were rightfully penalized, or quit the game. It does not matter if you have played 10 hours, 100 hours or 1000 hours. The management are generally not open for debate.This leads me to one such example that happened to me yesterday after having happily played the game for 675 hours. We were several people chatting in a private channel and the debate was about the prison pond and what got you sent there. It was generally agreed that profane words were a sure way to get sent to prison pond, but that you could get away with misspelling or abbrevations of such words.Myself, having never gotten sent to prison pond and considering myself a loyal player, at some point replied with a harmless personal opinion which included a four letter foul word. I did not think anything of it until about an hour later i found myself being teleported to prison pond.After this i stated my case on the forum as a technical issue, since i felt that the issue must have been a wrongly automated action. I was abruptly shut down and told that i violated the terms of service with a blacklisted word in my sentence. I then read through the whole of Russian Fishing 4's EULA (yeah, i had not read it beforehand, these days how many actually read these very large agreements written in legal speak?). To my large surprise i found nothing in the EULA stating that the sentence i wrote was in violation of it.I then posted about this, highlighting the parts of the EULA that could have had relevance but did not in my case. However, instead of having an adult conversation with the moderators, my post was deleted. I then reposted it. It got deleted. This repeated itself 4-5 times until an administrator posted a reply stating that i asked for an explanation of the ban and i got it. Ofcourse the administrator posted one of my earlier posts instead of the post where i was pointing out that i was not in violation of the EULA which is terribly convenient. At the same time my posts were marked for moderation approval, which in other words meant that i was cut off.So there you have it. Russian Fishing 4 is a great game in many aspects, but it comes with a serious flipside to the coin. In its current state i can not recommend it, as you as a player might get hit with the same misfortune as i did, effectively wasting very many hours of otherwise enjoyable play.But do not just take my word for it here. Plenty of review have complaints like mine but nothing to back it up with. Luckily i saw the direction things were headed in, and captured screenshots of the conversations so that you as a potential new player will know what you will be up against before deciding to play:Some of the screenshots may be in the wrong order or overlapping slightly, and i apologize for that. Regardless, should you decide to play anyway you may want to have the above in mind. Good luck and have fun :)",

                "text": "This game is a Korean grinder but in Russian style. Why? Let me start. First of all you can say \"hey, it's a free game, what do you expect?\" but no, believe me - this game only looks free. Be preared that without golden coins bought for real money and Premium pass you will acheve... i wanted to use four letter word used for stool. First few hours of game are pretty fun - quite good leveling tempo but when you will get to level around 20, POOF! you join an elite group of russian fishermen who goes fishing just to drink vodka. You stil cath the fish like before but you realize that they are worth, again a word for stool. Prices for gear are ridiculous, and i mean RIDICULOUS. After 180 hours of grinding for best gear you can make like 100-150 siver per real time 1,5-2 hours and good medium class rod is like 1500-2000, reel is the same and line plus bait another 300. Then you realize that you must have the skill to get more fish. and guess what - skill goes quite fast... for first few levels! you want to use ground bait? sure, prepare couple of thousand silver coins to level the groundbait making and clisk on crafting for few hours. I have houndreds of groundbaits made and still have around 50% of skill tree.  Be also aware that with certain percent of skill you unlock another ingredients. the same goes for all other skill trees. You want to catch a fish with good price to sell? Forget it, without a proper groundbait you will only catch some trash species not worth catching. On low levels you can only catch certain species of fish which are:1. ruining your gear and worth **** (prepare for repair costs of a 100 worth reel like 200 silver)2. small, common and worth ****Be also aware, that most of the server resets and patches are ruining most of the water bodies bite rates and your spots. If you will find a spot where you can get decent fish for farming silver, be sure that devs will show you their middle finger and reset it very soon.I'm really trying to give that game a chance but this is just too frustrating... another thing - no ingame market. you have a friend who has better stuff and want to share with you? he have to get Premium for real cash to get the option to give you something! but does not matter - in most cases if you dont' have enough leve or skill, you will not be able to use it anyway. that is so well designed - no shortcuts, grind or pay.i can continue with such stories but this does not make any sense.Concluding - if you have some time to waste and strong nerves, go on. waste your time. MAybe you will end like me thinking \"maybe this was all a bad joke and now i'll start to get some good fish\". I can tell you straight away - No. Never.",

                "text": "Alright, I got 160 hours into this game, made it to high level to play all the maps, and now I feel I can give my honest review of the game.It needs A LOT of work. It IS NOT pay to win, meaning there is at no point of the game you need to purchase anything to continue playing EXCEPT, that it is, and I will explain how.The concept of this game is great, you start out as a character that has never fished before, has a limited amount of money, and is trying to start out. As you go to enter the tackleshop, you see reels and rods in the thousands of silver cost, and you started out with a measely 50 silver. So you think, shouldnt be too hard to save up. Wrong. Each fish you catch will average about 0.05 silver, if you catch a nice size fish, it will jump up to about 1.20ish at low levels, if you catch a trophy, it will be around 10-20 silver for the fish, but a trophy fish is extremely rare, only 1 caught out of the 160 hours of fishing I have put into this game. By the time you make it to level 12, you might have enough silver to buy a LEVEL 5 SET UP, and at this lake, are fish that will literally destroy it, or take 45 minutes of your time away trying to land a fish worth 5 silver. The money can start coming in at level 16 when you hit kouri lake, but the thing is, now you need level 16 gear AT LEAST to land these fish, and these reels and rods will be about 900-1400 silver EACH. Even at Kouri (one of the best silver per hour maps) you will make on average 100-200 silver AN HOUR. A decent reel at level 20 costs 2000 silver, so you will be looking at 10-20 hours of grinding, and not spending any of it, just to get a reel. Then as your usin that reel to save for a better rod or say even another, you will start to notice it just doesnt have the stopping power it use to, oh guess what, you got to repair it! Repair costs for the reel will be anywhere from 30-70% of the cost of the reel to just repair. So in the long run, no this game does not have a pay to win wall where you cannot advance anymore. It has one discretely, giving you the option to continue the game for free and literally not get anywhere, or buy gold and premium time to repair your rod and reels without spending insane amount of silver, along with no wait time. I would much rather pay $60 for a game, than a free to play game with microtransactions. Also, if it was not for some people to pass down there gear to me at lower level, I wouldn't of even commited 10 hours into this game. EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GET STARTED. ALL THE SHOPS ARE OUT OF LOW LEVEL GEAR, NO INTENTION OF A FIX.more info on the game can be found on their website/forumsI only recommend this game if you dont mind a grind, can't get out fishing, and just simply love to fish, but today, I cannot recommend the game for anyone to try given its current state.For me it was fun while it lasted, but the grind isn't fun to me anymore.",

The thing that made me give up is the attitude of the devs and admins.  They see any feed back that isnt 100% posative as an affront and just argue with and insult players looking for help.   The other day I was explaining in disc why the recent changes had made the game much less enjoyable for me after 1400hrs played and JimmyHendrix, one of the head admins on the forums and in disc, called me lazy, game me conflicting and false info about game mechanics and perma banned me from disc for insulting him once in frustration.This was in response to him calling me lazy and telling me all info and explanations are in the patch notes.  Here is the last patch note- The balance of populations on the Sura River was adjusted, fish on this reservoir could change their habitats and baits preferences.- The price of Russian Sturgeon is reduced by 10%The note doesnt even say a change was made, just that it could have.  Never mind that populations were adjusted gives about as little info as possible.  From playing the game it seems that this means that fish will just stop biting all together for no apparent reason, or just jump off your hook (simultaniously happening to groups of people fishing in the same area at the same time) despite doing everything that is supposed to prevent this and getting no feedback what causes it other than bad rng.Also according to Jimmy, groundbait makes the fish you catch bigger rather than increasing the rate at which you catch fish.  This is counter to common sense of how groundbait works, my experience with using it in the game, and the ingame tool tip which reads \"use groundbaits to catch more fish\"So if your idea of a fun fishing game is dealing with Russian trolls for admins and devs then this is the game for you.UPDATE:I can not help but notice that in the last 3 days there have been a spike in the number reviews of this game, almost all positive after having mixed reviews for months.This looks like the Russians are at it again with generating fake reviews to drown out the negative reviews from actual players. I hope someone at Steam takes note and corrects this.",

Lately this game has went the route of cutting the amount of fish actively caught by players to near nothing in the hopes of players spending real money to buy premium items people are leaving this game in droves. I post this review knowing full well that it could result in my account being banned for a negative review but I no longer care about a game that at one time brought my inner fisherman so much joy.

The admin, Elwoodiath2 runs all communication like a dictator/Hitler. There is absolutely no tolerance for criticism or even a hint of negative tone. Imagine you are frustrated, you go on to discord and ask a question while saying something like, \"is this seriously meant to be a fun mechanism?\" As soon as the admin or a mod sees your post, it will be deleted and/or you being banned. The admin has threatened to ban me or worse...Im not kidding, thats exactly what he said. So the level of professionalism doesnt exist. The game. It is extremely grindy. In the 7 months Ive played this game so far, all I have seen are nerfs, addition of bugs, accidental addition of content thats broken and not ready for public release yet and a new map for high level players that is littered with bugs. The team is so incompetent that I have not seen a single patch note that fixes the many bugs of the game. I dont know if they dont care or if they just dont know how to fix the game. To give you an example, at night in the Tunguska map, the moon will appear in front of the tree box. Its a joke and people have mentioned several times over the months and its still not been fixed.\"Early Access\". Its a complete lie, all they are doing is adding grind/nerfs and more content so people buy premium and $$. No bug fixes and 0 communication with the players. No one knows when the next content patch is or if its a bug fix patch. There is 0 communication btw the devs and the players. How is this EA then?Dictatorship. Ive already talked about how unprofessional the admin is and how they do not communicate and silence people who question them. I wanted to mention a case study about Paul. He was an RF4 streamer and he was the most helpful player this game has ever seen. If you google, \"Paul RF4 Megasheet\", the first result is his excel sheet that just about everyone uses for this game. He reasearched and made an excel sheet on the best ways to grind the game. What happened was one day there was a quick patch and it was brought to the teams attention that a secret nerf took place. After stating the facts and questioning the devs why the patch notes didnt mention them, Paul was warned and later on banned. He was a good guy and geniunly helped the community. His last words are over in his sheet: Im MistaH1N1 and I have streamed and made videos totalling several hundreds of hours and have tens of thousands of views total. I have advertised and brought a positive light even the devs couldnt dream of. But after noticing their actions I just cant recommend this game and support it anymore. If you spend money on this game, you are supporting the greediest dictators, joke of a f2p game. Is this what you want to see all f2p gaming companies do? I wouldnt be surprised if this was posted on discord or foum and a mod/dev/admin saw it and banned me on the forum and ingame right away.",

                "text": "Avoid if you know what is good for your WALLET!The devs continually decrease prices in GOLD, but INCREASE prices for silver for in game gear in order to try to extort players for money. On top of this, top end reels in game can cost as much as $200, if not more. UPDATE: I just checked the most expensive reel which is around 120 Gold in game. This would cost $240.00 according to their website. Completely absurd. I have been a paying customer from July 4th 2019, until March 2020. I sincerely wish I never spent a cent on this stupid piece of crap, not to mention what my added up total came up to, which I am totally not proud of. On top of this: The devs will ban anyone whom they see fit. Does not matter if they already made money off them or not, they are just shady and greedy bastards whom care for nothing else but profiting off of naive player base whom continue to pay them. I have  had enough of their greed and general mistreatment of longtime supporters, which is why I feel it is necessary to report their behavior. They also completely destroy any legitimate ways to actually make in game money, thus forcing players to spend real money to be able to buy gear. On top of all this, their prices for gold and gear are absolutely absurd, considering that for one single reel in game bought for gold, one could easily buy a legitimate starter fishing kit IRL for less than what they charge for virtual gear. Also, the game encourages spending gold, which is purchased for money, and the prices are downright absurd. I wish I could post a screenshot here, but for comparison's sake, just look at their website and convert the gold prices for top end gear to real money if you truly want to give yourself a heart attack. This game should be abolished from existence, greedy developers like these guys should not be allowed to operate on this scale. Just as an example: You can buy 500 Gold for $800 where I live. That is more than enough to cover what I already mentioned in my rand above. And what can you buy for 500 gold, you might ask? The answer is: NOT THAT MUCH. Good luck grinding you life away if you do not want to spend real life money!TLDR:The devs are really in it just for the money, and also: THIS GAME WILL NEVER BE OUT OF THE BETA STAGE, AS HAS BEEN THE CASE FOR LAST 2+ YEARS. I would not recommend this game to anyone with any common sense left. If you really want to play it, set up a new free to play account and do not support these greedy bastards.  And for the players who contribute by paying for their \"Premium Subscription\", heed this warning: add up the amount of money you have spent on premium alone and you may just become shocked, just like I was. On top of the premium: the promises they give you are about 20% fulfilled when you do have premium. Crafting and harvesting baits DOES NOT COUNT in this case. If they truly cared about the game, they would not have re-skinned mosquito lake. They would have developed a new map. But their laziness and greed definitely got the better of them. Heed this warning. Enough said!",

The amount of available tackle, feed and bait are jaw dropping. Unfortunately, I still would not recommend it to anyone in its current state.* The XP grind makes a Korean MMO blush. For example, to reach lv20 I need around 150K XP. The average fish on the map Old Burg nets me 200XP right now. And that's rounding up.* Same for gear. A somewhat decent rod + reel will cost you 1000 silver. Expect your fish to sell for less than one silver each.* Buying gear for RL cash (gold) is insanely expensive. A mid-level rod + reel and assorted baits will easily set you back $50. It's actually cheaper to go fishing IRL.* If you decide to bite the bullet and invest RL money in gear, you'll find that this is a beta and rules can change. One day, rods can be repaired. Suddenly, rules change and your expensive rod can become perma-broken. And not through hundreds of hours of play: Just getting your line stuck will do it. Ooops, hahah, beta! And there goes your money.This game has everything to be awesome. Instead, it got mired in its punishing economy. Play it if you're content with tossing out a float but expect to never see most of the XP-locked content.",

When the float goes under its also very realistic. So all bite mechanics are really good.CON's- Extremely slow in progression, most will agree that its really bad when trying to progress even a little in this game.- Everything is a grind and this paired with the slow progress is a real turn off.- When leveling bait you end up with more than you can use and you've only leveled it by 1%- The best rods and gear cost a lot of real world money which are 100's of pounds, dollars etc so unless you own an oil company or have shares in banking you'll never get the high end gear.- Not enough info when targeting a certain species.Overall I don't understand the direction in which this game is going.

                "text": "I have 700h before steam release and it will become more, but here is why I dont recomend itRussian Fishing 4 probably is the best fihsing sim together with euro fishing, but it still has some issues.First and key why I dont recomend it is their community team. If you play, just dont take part in the forum, or you will get mad. The team handling the community are, with one of the new ones being an exception, in my eyes a group of amateurs who are new to this kind of work. One response to a complaint about making groundbait by a fed up social media worker on twitter looked like this: \"Thank you. Given how many times you were \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, we're sure you must be a happy fellow. We'd love to get \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 as well. Unfortunately we're tired and have a huge headache for being yelled at. have a nice day.\" Other posts proofing that the community was given false informations were just deleted and the posters blocked. thats not very professional.Another example for the lack of professionalism is when they decide everything on a topic has been said, they just delete every post with further comments on said topic. Also they dont communicate very well with each other, cause after a server crash where people lost their fish the first people to complain got the silver for the fish. After some time they decided that this would be too much and just stopped giving people the silver. As comepensation they gave everyone 10 days of prem, but regarless if you lost anything or not.When you ask for the exact amount the skillpoints buff your chances on a trophy, you get no answer cause they know that those numbers are stupidly low. Which brings me to the things that are still going wrong in game.1: Still no exact numbers of how much skill points buff your skills, for all of them.2: Skill progression for Harvesting, groundbait and lures is way too slow even with premium. To get 100% in harvesting for example you need ~1000h of \"normal\" skilling or invest an abnormal amount of silverSkill progression of the fishing techniques is ok, if you have premium, cause it doesnt limit your gaming experience that much.3: Leaders and live baits(except for frogs, they are op). Since the introduction of fluoro leaders the steel ones are basically useless cause you get 1 fish/h and with fluro you just get snapped by the first bigger pike. I dont get how this is considered real by the devs. I fish with steel leaders exclusively when spinning cause there are pike in my water and never had any trouble hooking said pikes, zander or catfish.The problem with live bait is similar. even with fully skilled live bait you still catch only small fish.( my record is a pike that was smaller than the bait) The whole reason to fish with live bait is to get bigger fish at the cost of bite rates. I wouldnt mind low bite rates if i have a decent sized fish guaranteed. My guess is that the devs, who claim to be fishermen, only fish for carps and the likes, cause predator fishing is still not close to realism.4: Hook Sizes dont matter for the size of fish that bites. I trust my 700h of gametime more than what the mods in forum say. From my experience the only thing influenced by the size of the hook is the probability of losing the fish if the hook is too small/big. 100g fish biting continously on 1/0 hooks is very far from the so often stated realism.5: Groundbait has too less of an impact.For me the rest is fine. I cant really judge the shops being out of stock, cause this stops being an issue at level 20 and i never minded the grind, which also gets better as you reach volkhov(lvl20, this takes a fairly long time tho with low gear). If you dont like grinding tho, dont pick up the game, you wont catch a lot of different fish until later in the game.",

On Monday I\u2019ve notice that my name is not among the winners. I\u2019ve asked moderator why he ignored my post because my white bream was 554g and I should get the prize. He\u2019s answered that my forum nick isn\u2019t the same as ingame name and he has to ignore my application. I\u2019ve informed him that in the rules there is no word that my forum name must be the same as ingame name so I should get my prize. He has edited post with challenge rules and added requirement about the names, took a screenshot and sent to me as a proof lol. I\u2019ve decided to inform administrator about this unfair behavior. The answer was shocking because admin was very rude and informed that having two accounts is a violation of the license agreement, he is going to ban me and he did it. I\u2019ve checked English EULA and I haven\u2019t found anything about multi accounts but in polish version it is illegal to own more than one account.

Game itself would do for players who don't mind a huge, long grind but the community management and attitude towards players is outrageous.Community is broken up into several regions, everyone sits in some closed channels and in-game chat is basically dead. Forums and discord are ran and moderated by company staff and any complaints will result sooner or later in a ban. If there is no real reason to ban you then they will take some word out of context and ban you for that, even while they themselves know that's ridiculous and doesn't add up.For example few days ago a streamer who was very helpful to the community was banned just for complaining that there was clear nerf of new venue after server restart while there were no patch notes at all. That's how it looks like, you've been warned. When you buy new \u00a3350 IRL money worth reel to catch the new big fish that's on fire on newly released venue be aware that week later there might be nothing to catch on it after restart and when you complain you will get banned and your voice will not be heard.Most crooked devs I've seen in 20 years of online gaming. Currently this game is aspiring to be rightfully called 'Fraud'.",

The gear you buy cost too much like one reel in the game is like you buy a reel in real life, you letarally don't earn money and most of them you spent to repair gear. Fishing fights are just too much. Staying with a 200kg fish with best gear in game and fought it for more then 3/4 hours. Not even in real life you struggle like that with fishes. Water physics and fish physics in game doesn't exist; you literally fish in a blue block that simulate water. Developers are slow to release updates and don't listen to comunity and also be frustrated if you report bugs or staff like that. They aim to realism and tons of people think this is a simulation or a great fishing game. It is not! Just a money grabber, if you want to advance and if i could ask for money back i would do it till last dollar.. By the way try it for yourself and you will see if i'm saying bad things or just reality.",

Don't by premium because it really gives you nothing but xp and trade no xtra silver so you stay with bad rods at a higher level. 6 months ago i would give this game a 5 star rating now i give it a no star rating because the devs destroyed their own game on perpose. There is no real way to make silver anymore so they force you to us money to by stuff. R.I.P RF4 you had something great and you hurt yourself by greed.

                "text": "On several occasions. I purchased items with silver that i paid real USD for. Never received those items. The last time i decided to file a support ticket. I get an email back saying they refunded me 300 silver and then proceeded to accuse me of lying. While at the same time telling me there was no way for them to track it. Then verbally threaten me with banning my account because they went through my chat history and found some (naughty) things i had said. All of which were taken out of context. (Accused me of making racist comments) Sent email back telling them not to threaten me. An that their are no posted rules (anywhere in game) on what language is acceptable and is not acceptable. Along with the fact if they believe i made a racist comment that they were misunderstanding something. As i am married to someone of color.  I get email back saying due to \"Threats\" \"racist remarks\" and \"threats against others\" my account was banned. They had copied and highlighted several comments i had made in game. ALL of which were not in their entirety. They had only taken parts, a few words, out of conversations and tried to make like i was saying something i wasnt. Real dangerous company this is. I am filing a complaint with the Attorney General, BIT, Steam, paypal and the Consumer protection agency. They also use the claim they are an American company. Even tho the only part of their company is the Holding company who controls their money.Edit 5/30/19 11:30pmGO READ OTHER NEGATIVE REVIEWS, LOOK AT DEV'S REPLY BELOW.  THIS SHOULD ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT INVESTING TIME AND MONEY IN THIS GAME. Devs and admins accuse you of things. Now just today accuse me of lying about everything in an attempt to steal money / goods from them and trying to scam them. (I might add, the initial request, started on steam was simply asking them where i could find my in game transaction history. A steam forum admin replied asking me what the problem was and told me there is no way to see my in game transaction history. Then told me to go to their website and submit a support ticket. He asked me what it was i didnt think i had gotten. I explained that i had purchased many things, but i know for a fact i did not get 2 of the hooks i had just bought. One of the admins, i dont remember if it was in the email or steam says to me, Well it is kinda hard for us to see what you didnt get if you dont know what your missing. Dumbfounded, i explained to him, if there is no way for me to view my in game transaction history it is kinda hard for me to tell what i didnt get. (With not being able to view your own transaction history you are left that their word. You get NO way for you yourself to see whether an item was purchased, whether coin was deducted or your item received) Which is ILLEGAL. It would be like going to a store and purchasing something and demanding a receipt and them refusing to give you one. An claiming, well if you end up needing a receipt you can just call and trust us. Now today i get this email from them: \"You were given benefit of a doubt and given silver for items you did get, after further review, it became obvious you lied and lost the items in question. As well as you sent threats, tried to abuse the support team and the game. As well as broke many rules on many occasions.\"Glad i only gave them around $40.00 of my money! Devs also abuse dev follow up review privileges to harass people who leave negative reviews. Reporting that as well.Notice how they say, \"In light of us trying to help you out\" I would be glad to show ANYONE upon request copies of all correspondence from them. Including the verbally abusive email i received from them as a solution.5/31/19 7pm - Again, still sending me threatening emails making false accusations. \"The only person making false statements is you, starting from your first email about items you didn't get, you clearly lied, we have a record of that. As well after that you tried tried to send threats, posted private information, defamatory, deceptive information as well.You got in-game currency from us, based on your deception and you still decided to break even more rules and regulations.All of this clearly falls under EULA.At this point you are not only broke in game rules but lawful agreement as well, and posting clearly provable defamatory and deceptive information that is illegal by law of any country.\"",

I am gonna quit the game now , no point in keep playing it without spending money and i am not gonna spend money.This game its all about  REAL MONEY , dont play it if you dont wanna spend money, simple as that.i know that after posting this i wont get any fish anymore(admins will take care of this) be aware peeps !Best of luck and i hope my review is helpful!",

                "text": "After a bit more than 400 hours, I suppose I can finally feel confident I know enough to review this game. I'll focus on the questions you might have when you see a free fishing game and the tags it has, or at least the questions I had when I first saw it. So without any more delay, here's my thoughts on Russian Fishing 4.The big one- \"Free\". How free is it? I have not paid for over 400 hours now and I've enjoyed my time fishing. So I would say it is very viable to play for free. The price for premium is roughly on par with a normal MMO's subscription at 12 euro/month.  You get a few perks out of it, but mostly it's just extra exp so you get to level up faster and get to unlock other areas and skills easier.As for the multiplayer aspect, I find this one just straight up weird. Only a few parts of this game appear to have any multiplayer to it. Aside from those parts it is essentially a single player game. These parts are a leaderboard and chat function. That one explains itself and makes sense. A competition system, but it isone that I've never found a use for since all the contests are in Chinese or Russian. So I have no idea what they're asking, and they seem to be limited to higher level players anyway so for about 300 hours I never qualified to get in even if I could read it.The ability to send items to other players only if you have paid for premium, and lastly the shop inventory can be sold out if other players buy a lot of it in a short time period.You do not get to sit next to a friend when fishing, see others fishing, or even really see what other people do at all. Your only interaction with others is through the chat window, and the occasional message in chat when someone catches a sizable fish.The gameplay- It's fishing. You cast lines and reel in fish. You can fish with bait both by float fishing and bottom fishing, and with lures both from the shore and by trolling. The way you fish seems to have an effect on how well you catch things, while time, temperature and weather matter as well. The detail is better than any I've seen before, and it feels like you can actually control what you catch and whether you're successful by paying attention to the circumstances. The gameplay itself is good. You sell fish you've caught for money or can release them for bonus experience, but that's not really an option. You need the money.The progression however is less good. I've spent a lot of time on it and I still use some of the beginner gear, and I've still not unlocked most of the areas. You never get enough money to buy anything, and I know you're thinking they want you to buy the premium currency for it to skip the grind, but they don't really support that. If you buy premium currency to get gear you will need to spend around the price of an actual physical fishing rod to get early to mid level gear. And that gear will deteriorate very quickly, requiring that you pay even more to get it repaired.It is honestly cheaper to just buy a fishing rod and go do actual fishing than it is to try to spend money on gear in this game.Your progression is limited mostly by money. You can unlock new places by leveling up, but what use do you have for a place known for fishing large carp if they'll destroy your gear with ease and then just swim away? Progression is very rough and there is no way to get around it. You will always be struggling for money and be limited by your gear.In conclusion, while I find it very strange how they handled balancing just about anything I have enjoyed my time playing Russian Fishing 4 and would recommend giving it a try. If you enjoy the gameplay and just want to sit down and fish, you might enjoy it too. But don't expect to reel in huge fish, or even just somewhat big fish. You're going to be fishing in the same waters with your small rods for a very long time before you can unlock anything else.",

                "text": "For the value - I would rate this one of the best games on Steam.  I originally picked it up as a free game that I expected to play for 15 or so minutes.  I like fishing IRL and thought it may be fun to tinker around with an RNG based fishing - coin toss.  Russian Fishing 4 is so much more than that:  PROS: \u2022 There's a pretty diverse fishing spots, you can explore the whole zone at your leisure, very reminiscent of Bass Pro Fishing Games.  Walk or take a boat, the exploration alone in RF4 is something to behold.\u2022 The fishing is MILES deeper than I expected it to be.  Plenty of species to catch and more styles of fishing than I knew existed.  There's 3 main types of fishing - Bottom Fishing | Spin Fishing | Float Fishing.  Of these three type, each type has a multitude of different rig set-ups that you can use - I'm 163 hrs in and it has been keeping it interesting thus far.  I have really only scratched the surface of what you can catch and I am still hyped about the m a s s i v e fish you can catch in this game.  \u2022 The selection of gear from fishing shops is very expansive.  It can be pricey, but I think it contributes to the gameplay loop.  There's \"companies\" that produce lines of products that can be purchased at the various shops \u2022 Like fishing, the community can be hit or miss, however, the people that I have had the opportunity to communicate/play with have been super cool.  I may have just been lucky but I found some nice anglers who helped set me up with some nice baits ~ if you read this review and decide to get RF4, hit me up ~ I'd be more than happy to pay it forward in the form of bait, gear or tips! CONS:\u2022 RF4 is a bit of a time sink and it's pretty slow going at first.  I have seen people describe it as a free to play, pay to win game; I have played both as a free-player and as a subscribed player and can agree that the experience is more pleasant as a paid member.  That being said, the game doesn't change much when you subscribe ~ you gain experience at an increased rate, which helps the game feel less grindy.  At the moment, I am pretty satisfied with my selection of lakes and gear so I am probably going to be on a free account for a while.  \u2022 Multiplayer is a strong word for what you can find in RF4.  Everyone is instanced to their own lake, so you're never going to run into another angler on the water.  I enjoy that other players can't tarnish the good fishing holes, but I would like to be able to invite another player to my instance so we could angle together.  Despite being instanced, there is a chat log that shows the notable actions of the other players in your area (or updates to global records) so you can communicate/compare notes with other players.  All in all I really enjoy this game.  I understand it is not for everyone, but what the hell it's FREE!  Give it a try",

So basically had to restart and add points to skills which hasnt helped in the slightest.

THESE PEOPLE ARE THE MINORTY. everyone ive spoke to hates it. several have quit. several others say they are going to take a break till its fixed, if its fixed. the family and friends i tried to get to play this game refuse to becuase of the grind BEFORE this change. again.. you want to stare at a screen where nothing happens make a wallpaper of it and play something else.this game is not worthwhile to play at this time. the grind went from over the top to out right demented. imagine playing a game where they randomly made it so some areas didnt give you xp or loot every other day, at random, and made you find out where it was.some sick roleplayer with no life might enjoy that. everyone else wont.i honestly hope they fix this so i, and others, can come back and enjoy it. then again they might go the route other games have.. so cocky they just dont care and leave it as it is.only time will tell.till then. avoid this game like the plauge.",

It's actually kind of fun. The problem is that it's a sickening money grab that's hardly been rivaled on Steam, and I've seen some some real nasty development companies come at you with all they've got. This one guy though has managed to work his way into the Hall of Shame with his behavior. I puke on his future residence in Hell.At first blush it seems kind of innocent, you can play for free, etc... But your best catches and best fish will always break your line, your reel, or your pole. If you upgrade, a bigger fish will be programmatically sent to break it. My daughter and I noticed this pattern while we played. We'd both get a broken piece and lose a big fish. We'd upgrade, get a decent fish, then we'd both get another pole breaker. It happened within like 5 or 10 minutes of each-other every time. So you know it's in the code.You can save your hard-earned in-game money for weeks to get a decent BEGINNER fishing pole, or you can pay him between 20 and 40 bucks. And yes, you can easily spend $250 on a single pole, but no single pole does everything. The weights and measures of the poles have been carefully set so that you need at least 3 poles to cover all your bases just for spinner fishing alone.Anyway, I suggest we find a better place to spend our time. You can't spend time in bad company and expect good results. Leave now.",

If you are considering putting real money into the game, then I DO NOT recommend the game. If you feel that you need to put money into the game, then stop playing it immediately, it is just not worth it and it will be a waste of your hard earned cash.I've had a lot of fun in this game in the hours I have put in, however when I first started playing when it was first released on Steam it was a better game to play. Since it's release the bite rates of fish seem to have plummeted, to the point where even with three rods in the water you can sit there waiting for a bite that may not come for too long of a time.In terms of realism then it's probably the best Fishing Sim available. The feeling of fishing and the methods available to you to utilise are fantastic. However, the issue is that you have to level up to use all the different methods, and leveling up even after paying for premium takes a very very long time. An unfeasible amount of time.If bite rates in the game increased to the point that it's no longer frustrating, then it would be a very fun game. But as it is at the moment, it's more frustrating. If you just want a chill free fishing game and don't want to reach any sort of end game, then I would recommend trying this game. If you want to fish and feel like you are progressing towards bigger and better things, catching a lot of fish along the way, then avoid this game. Or at least try it, but DO NOT put really money into it. Positives: - Realistic (apart from the bite rate)- Choice of baits- Available methods of fishingNegatives:- Extreme grind, even if you invest real money- The different methods of fishing are locked behind a progression system. You will have to invest 1000's of hours to unlock them all if you pay premium, it would be near impossible to unlock them all without paying real money for premium.- Bite rate decreases, this has happened over time and the player base has started to abandon the game as a result.There is a market for selling the in game fish which is affected by what is being caught and sold in the game at the time. I quite like this feature, but other do not.The in-game shops are stocked with a certain amount of items, and sell out when people buy them in the game as it is all online. Again, this is a feature which I quite liked, but some other players did not.I'd recommend giving the game a go as it's F2P, but I would not recommend putting any real money into the game.",

This game is perfectly playable without paying a dime and some of the global world records for catching fish are done by new players with the most basic gear while others by veteran players with some really Really expensive stuff. This game is a time killer, if you are looking for objective based, linear gaming this is the wrong kind of game for you. There are 10000 different lures and baits and a single degree in the weather can cause fish to stop biting. A spot that was hot a day ago could go dry for the next week or month IRL time. Pros:-Time consuming-Relaxing-Insane variety-Russian video game feelCons: -Russian video game feel-Not beginner friendly-Time consuming-It's hard to find help and guides for catching certain fish because the 'hot spots' and 'hot baits' are always changing.New player tips-Better, expensive lures and baits don't always mean more/bigger fish-Stronger fish that require hundreds of hours of gear to catch sell for less than some small fish-Save money and Invest in feeder fishing at lvl 6-Save your skill reset until you are atleast level 15-Fishing a few meters from shore is often better than casting far out. -Sometimes moving just a yard or three left or right can cause no fish to become lots of fish",

                "text": "Following, is a review by Dirty Kosby. I have decided to copy the exact same into my review because I agree 100% on his take on this unnecessary grinder rng game that deliberately works against players to cough up gold for insane irl values.\"Everything is way too expensive and the game is endless grind just to get basic items to be able to fish and have a decent time, but it's still one of the best fishing experiences in gaming. Fishing isn't something that translates well to a mouse and keyboard, nor a controller, but the mechanics and controls in this game are great.The only thing holding it back is the fact that the game actively works against you to force you into spending money (I got a lure stuck in grass and jerking to get it un-stuck didn't break my line, it broke my rod AND my reel, forcing me to buy new ones). I get that it's free to play and they have to make money, but it's so predatory that I refuse to spend any on principle. You have to level up your spinning fishing to 15% to unlock anything but the default spinning lures, for example. That doesn't sound like much, but I'm over 7 hours in and use nothing but spinning reels and I just reached 8%. That is crazy.On top of that, the price you get per fish you sell is abysmally low. Less than one coin for most fish. You might get 0.7 for most of the fish you can catch with starter gear. The cheapest reel is 18 coins, and the game forces you to buy new ones by ruining your current gear randomly (not to mention they also have a wear level). You can only catch small fish on that reel, though. To get into even mid-sized fish, you'll need a reel that costs a few hundred coins, then a rod that costs just as much, then lures/hooks/line that costs an absurd amount. That's dozens of hours of your life just to be able to fish properly, or way too much real-world money to speed it up. A \"personal best\" fish might sell for 1.5 coins, and I have caught one single fish that strained my gear to the limits and took me 10 minutes to get in for 7 coins. Other than that one fish, none have sold for 2 or more unless I filled the ridiculously specific and difficult cafe orders, which are (again) almost impossible to complete until you have better gear.Oh, and you have to eat and drink to keep your energy levels up. Once a day you can eat for free, but any more and you get turned upside down and shaken until your pockets are empty.I also want to add that they give you free spare equipment once per in-game day. It is always the same equipment, you just get to choose whether you want the spinning or floating gear. Either way, it's is the worst gear ever. Weak line, rusty hooks, a bamboo pole, and a feather for a bobber in the floating gear, or a 1930s rod and reel for spinning that are given to you at 50% wear already, are noisy, barely work and cost over 200 coins to repair. I'm lucky to have a stockpile of 20 coins while stuck with the default gear.With all of that said, the mechanics are fantastic and the actual fishing truly IS fun, but you'll be stuck using bread bait and a bobber on a cane pole for ages unless you either devote your life to the game or make $100,000 a year. I love the act of fishing in this game, I just can't fish how I want to fish or what I want to fish for because I am limited by the outrageous cost of literally everything in the game. I don't have time to work ANOTHER full-time job, and I definitely don't have the bank account balance to be able to fast track my way to getting where I want. Even if I did, I can not, in good conscience, willingly give money to developers this greedy and predatory. This would be hands-down the most enjoyable fishing game out there if I didn't feel even more stressed about money while playing it than I do in real life.\"",

The developers would love for you to believe that their game is so intricate, that there is a list of 25-50 or more factors that may affect whether the fish are biting or not...this list can be found on the RF4 forum, again posted by Lady of Games, this however is a complete load of hogwash. I have fished in the same location with a mate, with exactly the same gear, using the exact same lure/bait, at the exact same time, casting in the exact same direction, only to find that one of us is catching fish and the other is not....If RF4 doesn't have the most expensive ingame currency I have ever seen and am ever likely too, then they are darn close to it!!! and for what? To buy gold bait that gives you no added benefit? To buy gear earlier just so you have even less chance of actually hooking a big fish? The microtransactions are EXTREMELY overpriced for the ZERO added benefit you get from them.So, to anyone out there who is trying to call the players who have negatively reviewed this game, liars... there is a reason so many negative reviewers have the exact same content in their review...and it ain't because they are lying..So in conclusion, I do not recommend this game to anyone who likes to utilize a games forum for discussing the good AND the bad about a game. I would warn anyone very sternly, that unless you want to chance having all your posts on the forums moderated before they can be posted, dont disagree with or try and point out to the forum administrators where they have failed to answer your question. This happened to me and the reason they used was \"Abusive Behavior\"...However i actually have a screenshot of each part of the conversation that was deleted from the RF4 forum, proving that I was not abusive at all, but as I didn't care about posting on their forums anymore, i didn't bother following it up. Happy to send the file to anyone for a good read though and as proof of the integrity of the administrators.This game is fun to play, but only for a short period of time, once you have that high level gear, good luck finding fish that are worthy of the gear strength...or even at all...Daffy.",

First levels you will be very appriciated with catching fullhands of fish. I played about year and can say about mid and highend content. EVERYTHING that makes profit will be nerfed. Every fish or bait that players found to make some reasonable profit already nerfed. And they wont stop to bait you on donate. So do not listen peoples with high level cuz they already farmed everything before nerfes and do not need money for new equipment.In second, they think that they are unique smartass developers with own anticheat system, but if some devs like  DICE always communicate with players and community can make changes (all remember bans from DICE for using WOLF overlay for Teamspeak), this freak NEVER listen community.Their \"unique migration of fish\" its just an shadowban for some time. They never told details of this system, but after few hours of good fishing u will be banned and will catch very small fish or even no fish at all (5 real hours without fish with place and lkes changing at 30 lvl - easy). Its like an energy bar in mobile games! Useless craft, cuz all highen craft can be bought in shops - Boilers in huge assortments.Idiotic system with sizes of hooks. U can catch 30g Gibel and 22kg Catfish on one hook. There is no database and guides. Nerf and shadowbans. I never can repeat any info from friends or forum about baits or places.Dont waste ur time.",

                "text": "This game has hidden Endgame Mechanics / Settings made by the Devs which do punish you in several ways to slow down your progress:*If you get your endgame gear which does mean you invested at least 1.000 RL hours of grinding, or ~150h + $500,- and you are finally able to land ~10 kg fishes instantly and go for the hunt of 50+ KG fishes you will have a way lower bite rate than usual with the exact same setup you used before, to slow down your progress......(I am not talking about you won\u00b4t catch big fishes, the GENERAL bite rate of mid/high value fishes will diminish heavily and yes, I do know all the mechanics with different baits, hooks, braid, mono, fluoro, leaders, light, Ultra light setup, different weather conditions and so on.It is about that the BEST and STRONGEST gear ingame, which should provide the MOST EFFICIENT fishing and should be seen as ENDGAME GOAL is RIGGED by the Devs.)* If you stay longer than 1 RL hour at the same place your biterate will go down by 90% (Bigger fishes), to slow down your progress. Due this You will be forced to change places all the Time, which is really tedious, annoying and Time consuming.*There is one exception, which is a so called Hot Spot, there you can fish for a long Time at the same spot, but those places also expire with a different rate. Good fishermen who catch fishes quickly, can be there for like 4 RL days, but for other people the spot is active for several weeks....*One more thing to mention generally:If you read several reviews here you will see plenty of \"Shops sold out\" and \"really grindy leveling process\" statements.BOTH do not matter at all if you compare it with the income of silver, for a decent endgame setup you need around 10k silver (1 Rod). Till you reach that, or even the 30k for all 3 Rods, you will have unlocked everything ingame a long long long Time ago.Enjoy the leveling process, during that you will have a really nice bite rate, plenty of different Fishes and a good Time in general. As further you will go you will realize small changes towards the meantioned things and when you reach endgame most of it will be totally gone.The Numbers I mentioned here are not inflated by any means, it is even leaning more towards the other side, to reach it in that Time you have to fish efficient, a cast and pray player will need surely twice as long.You have to understand that this game is free to play, which does mean the obvious thing, you either invest plenty of Time and just enjoy what you are doing, or you invest a decent amount of money to speed up your progress, which is absolutely fine for such a game model.A GAME should never punish people for playing it and Russian Fishing 4 was in the last few months developed towards exactly this direction, which is absolutely ridiculous and heart breaking for gamers.The current direction does remind me a bit at Fishing Planet and their patch 0.7.0 where the ship sank with the inplementation of bait coins and a cooldown Timer (which prevented you from fishing if you were good...).I hope Russian Fishing 4 will change their direction to avoid the colission, till a few months ago it was an amazing an outstanding game.Edit: Just to clarify something, do not get me wrong, I loved the game and I still like it.I just simply hate and find such mechanics disrespectful towards the players.We invest hours of RL Time, to find spots with decent fishing, or at least spend Time to ask or look at the Forum and nowdays when you log in, you know you will get 1 hour of good fishing (with the new XP bonus which makes the gap towards needed silver even bigger) and then you have to decide to either, switch fish species, switch location or switch to another map. Let us just fish as before, who does get hurt when people have fun catching carps over and over, or burbots, or chars, or sturgeons or or or. I mean for Level 1-40 you need 126 Million XP, for level 41 alone you need 90 Million XP so progressing will be slow anyways and the extra levels also do not provide any advantage besides a few more skillpoints you can choose....There is simply no freaking reason what you are doing to us and your Game.Ps: Noone does expect to catch every hour 20 carps, but getting always 20+ in the first hour and the hours afterwards it goes down to an averrage of 3-4 pieces is ZERO FUN towards people who are willing to invest more than 1 hour a day.",

The premium package for the game is scandalous at best with the only benefit being a slight increase in XP which is pointless after level 30 anyway. The game has a great community but the community is constantly being let down with very odd choices being made to game play and features.  The in game purchases for real money are very much geared around the Russian player base whom are able to buy things for real money at a reduced rate to the rest of the player base.  The catch rate and quality of the catches are also skewed towards the Russian player base. The game has also become awash with hackers which makes competing on the leader boards a pointless exercise. The tutorial to the game is pretty much non existent as is the end game content. Avoid at all costs.",

If I didn't switch off the steam version, my family shared library would be locked for most of the day every day. Not because the game is that good, but because of the grind.Don't get me wrong, the game  be enjoyable. Its probably the best fishing game on Steam or elsewhere. But the grind is so bad.  to finally be able start catching moderately large (5-10 kg) fish. This is like the Black Desert Online of fishing games.To do this grind, you'll have to sit through large periods of time where the fish *will not* bite. No matter what you try. They will straight up stop existing for half an hour or more of real time. Then when they do show up, chances are, you're going to catch something you can't handle and your equipment will break. This is extra bad because it costs in-game money that you've done hours of grinding to get just to repair your items that the fish can break at any point. Bought a 30 silver lure? Too bad, the first fish that got hooked snapped the line before you could react, go get another one.Once you get past the first couple of items things start costing .  You can fish for actual real life days just to afford a new reel. Then you have to go do *even more* grinding for the line and rod to match.I haven't even gotten into the skill system and we're already talking about dozens of hours of tedious, boring gameplay. The skill system is just the exact same grind but now with a chance to fail and get nothing for it.You may notice that I'm not mentioning the rest of the game at all, that's because when it comes down to it the grind is such a devastatingly huge problem for the game that paying attention to any other aspect is really useless.",

I am playing it for years now, alongside of all the others fishing game available in the market. Update after update they add lakes, fish species, equipment and add even more complexity in terms of different tackle you can setup : But here comes the catch, as i call it the fishing method (and not the fisherman way, the hacker way) the more product you can purchase in game, the more chance you spend real life money to get them, because alongside of every update, they are nerfing the fish spawnrate.In short for anyone not used to this game a good amount of silver ( money IG ) is 100-200 Silver/H currently, and it still a lot. The endgame gear is around 30 000 Silver for one Reel! A complete endgame feeder setup will cost you around 80 000 Silver, yes, you understand right. If you plane yourself on doing constantly 200 silver/hours it will take you 400 hours to get ONE ENDGAME ROD, and to make money you need 3 of them.But its not the end, on your way grinding endgame you will have to repair your reel, you can pay with real money and have it ready instantly, or you can pay with silver ( cost a lot ) and you will have to wait HOURS real life to be able to use it again.Another things is the skill system and currently the way they nerfed for the last 2 years constantly update after update fish biterate, is : You have different three, float, bottom, spinning, in each three you have a %, each fish you caught have a CHANCE to increase ur skill by 0.1/0.2%, in 450Hours, i'm still at 83.2% bottom fishing.Today i've spend 9 hours in front of my computer and i've caught a wopping total of 11 fish, wich result into 85Silver.Thats what you get with this game. DO NOT PLAY IT, I've tried to come back again to see if they fixed the things but no, its even worst than before. You will be amazed by the depth of the game but soon as you are hooked, you know you're f. You know the dice are rigged.I hope i save you sometimes.This game is only for the people who have a lot of real life money, or the one that can play 18h/day.",

Buying on Steam just adds another layer of DRM.-If you previously purchased through Origin, you will need to redownload any DLC, even if you already had it installed-Your DLC carries over, the base game does not, which means you'll have to purchase the base game again.-Your DLC doesn't 'unlock' through Steam's store, if you purchased it on Origin (because of course it doesn't)This is probably the worst Steam integration I've ever seen. Don't buy it here if you already own it, just use \"add non-Steam game to library\". It's almost identical and $20 cheaper.",

Buy it HEAVILY DISCOUNTED bundled with one of the major expansions (Seasons or Pets), and MOD THE \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 OUT OF IT!!Base Sims 4 is nearly unplayable due to the lack of content, repetitive and easily manipulative emotions system, and an overall feeling of restriction. Which is damaging in a game series that is designed around player freedom. There are also so many irritating qualities to it that make it seem like it wasn't fine tweaked enough. Why is every single Sim such a social butterfly that I cannot get them to stop talking to each other for five seconds? Why do they take so long to eat? Why are the lots so small and so empty? Why is nearly nothing from Sims 3, and heck, even Sims 2 brought over?? (Horses, Cars, pools, restaurants, grocery stores, fun recreational activities, ect.)With that being said, there is some classic Sim Fun to be had with this game, if you are able to get it for a heavily discounted price and get it bundled with one of the major expansions (I would recommend either Pets or Seasons). I would also highly recommend downloading a plethora of Mods, because they fix a vast majority of the systems in base Sims 4 that make it more enjoyable. If Mods are not your thing, then I would think twice about purchasing this game. **This is one of the easiest games to Mod fyi**Mod Recommendations (Like seriously, don't even play base Sims 4 before downloading these Mods)Sims 4 Mod Manager by Raxdiam (Not necessary, but a very convenient and easy way to keep track of your mods. Very user friendly, will do 100% of the work for you)Meaningful Stories by roBurky (A mod pack that effectively revamps the mood and emotions systems of Sims 4. This makes the systems feel waaay more fleshed out and realistic, and significantly less manipulatable)Better Romance by simler90 (Adds more rules and checks into how Sims romance one another. In base Sims 4, you are basically always guaranteed to succeed in romance. There is quite literally no way to fail. This Mod expands heavily upon it, making it so that the traits Sims have will impact whether or not they will accept any advances.)Wonderful Whims by TURBODRIVER (Goes great with Better Romance with no compatibility issues that I'm aware of. Adds in an Attractiveness system, first Impressions, Personality Archetypes, and even a Menstrual Cycle and Birth Control system. With this, you are more equipped to design your Sims overall sexuality and sexual lives. Hugely rewarding, and designed perfectly that it will seem like it is a natural part of the game.)There is also a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 load of CC (Custom Content) out there like clothes, hair, buildings, Sims, ect. \"Mod The Sims\" is the best place to find all of this. Don't spend money on any of the Stuff Packs, because most of that stuff included in them you'll find for free made by someone online. Usually looks nicer too.",

Setting aside all of the EAisms about the game (obscenely expensive expansions to get basic game play features that should be in the base game, over inclusion of social media aspects, etc.) I was expecting a phenomenal experience. Instead, they seem to have limited the ability to travel, removing the semi-open world of TS3 and instead reverting back to a very old school system of traveling to what basically amounts to a few city blocks, which was the most disappointing feature. You can no longer have your sims travel to work in a real environment, instead they do the ole disappearing act and reappear after 8 hours. No more travelling to a grocery store, all supplies are magically bought and created out of thin air. I felt like I was playing TS1 or 2 again, and everything feels very stripped down and bare-bones, very much like a mobile game.To be fair, they have added a much more in depth sim creator, which is pretty cool if that's all you care about. The AI system seems to work better too with interactions between sims being more fluid and natural.Overall, disappointed. Wouldn't recommend.",

Oh and don't even try to think about buying all the DLCs because it will cost you 500$ to do so. No game deserves to be 500$. I mean if you're a popular youtuber you could get the DLCs for free?So if you want a much more watered down almost mobile game level experience then buy this game if not stay the hell away from it.

                "text": "I have a long history with the Sims franchise. I started playing The Sims 2 when I was a child because of my mother (and, back in the day, even my grandmother played it). I remember The Sims 3 coming out. I've loved these games ever since I can remember, and they have a very special place in my heart. Buying this game on Steam was kinda useless, seeing as I already owned it since its release in 2014 on Origin (frankly, I just wanted to see those hours pile up on Steam whenever I get into the cycle of Remember Game Exists > Play Game Obsessively For A Short Period > Forget Game Exists, and I felt a little guilty about my, uhm, less-than-legitimate maritime exploration, to put it in a cute little ~metaphor~, of all of the DLC content over the years).Now, would I recommend The Sims 4? Honestly, it depends. There are many different kinds of Simmers, and I don't think this is the most adequate for every single one of them.Lore-wise? Girl, put on an eyepatch and go explore the Sims 2. If you're expecting fleshed out, non-half-assed stories, this will disappoint. (And it has. Why did they do the Caliente sisters this dirty? Why? I just wanna know...)Building-wise? 100% MADE FOR YOU, BUY IT. I have never considered myself a builder, ever, but this game... Oh, man, it really boosts my self-esteem, not gonna lie. Whenever I make house I'm really proud of, I showcase it to every one. It's great! I think everyone can agree that this game has the best Build-and-Buy Mode that the Sims franchise has ever seen.CAS-wise? Hmmmm, this one is tricky. Creating Sims is so fun, it's true, but without Custom Content? It's a no-go for me, thank you very much. I've recently discovered that a lot of people find the Sims 3 sims ugly, and that was honestly a HUGE surprise to me, because although the sims in The Sims 4 are much more aesthetically pleasing than in any of the other games WITH CUSTOM CONTENT INCLUDED, if I have to create vanilla sims? Nope. They're just kinda weird-looking, in my opinion, and I'd much rather play The Sims 3 if I'm not gonna include custom content.Now, one thing that should go without saying is that EA IS VERY GREEDY. This isn't news to anyone, I know, but I'm just saying this to emphasize that if you're not planning on buying any DLC for this game you may as well just go on a lawless maritime exploration of it instead of purchasing it, because the base game itself is NOT IT. At all. It gets boring after a while. My strategy going forward is probably going to be: play game > forget it exists > remember it exists > get the cheapest pack I can > play game with its new features. The DLC is very expensive, though, and that is something to remember. The Sims 3, for example, is worth playing with just the base game installed, in my opinion, so if you don't like to get absolutely scammed into giving EA your money, maybe try that one? Just don't get the Katy Perry stuff pack if you do decide to buy DLC after all. It's not worth it, bestie.(So, yes, while I know I am scamming myself at this point by monetarily supporting this game, I decided to do it anyway! It was an impulse-buy. But I digress,)Overall, The Sims 4 has gotten a lot better since it started. It's had a few hiccups along the road, and that's without counting the Star Wars pack, because I refuse to acknowledge that it wasn't a random fever dream I had. But it has gotten better, and I'd say it's worth playing if you pick a few DLC that you think you'll enjoy, and some Custom Content to your liking! I'd also recommend some mods like MC Command Center or other story progression mods just to make the game more realistic and fun. The Sims 4 community is active as hell on places like The Sims Resource or even Twitter and Tumblr, so make the most of it for your modding and/or objects and clothing needs. If you're not going to be taking part in any of that, though, for some reason... I'd refrain from playing this game at all. The Sims 4 is like sliced bread. You probably don't enjoy sliced bread by itself, or eat it very often, do you? It's plain, basic, and boring! The community provides some extra ingredients. If you won't be making a sandwich, you might as well not buy the plain-ass bread.",

                "text": "I broke down during the summer sale and bought the base game and several of the extras. I've been playing The Sims since its first version. When S4 came out I thought it might just be a money pit and stuck with S3, despite the many bugs 3 had. S3 had an awful lot of content.I'm giving The Sims 4 a recommend, but barely. The first impression of it hasn't been as good as I'd hoped, and I'm still on the fence about cost/benefit. Here's a typical pro/con list after the first inning or so:Some Pros:- The graphics. By far the most beautiful of the Sims games and with a slightly better create-a-sim interface, although see Cons below. The in-game look is terrific, especially the lighting, and the different \"worlds,\" which are really just neighborhoods your sim visits, load faster than they did in 3. This is because each neighborhood is small. Instead of forty lots and properties in one place that have to be loaded, you have maybe 12 places to each neighborhood with more neighborhoods, and travel is fast. The energy in the game was very clearly channeled into making everything look great and to take you much faster to a place you want to visit.- The more sophisticated mood manager. There's a state-of-mind thing in the game beyond the basic needs. You can be inspired, happy, energized, focused, and the total package of moods has its own benefits. Neat idea.- Bigger, smoother group gatherings. Putting a group together in the Sims 3 was always an iffy, glitchy, chaotic affair. S4 has a much better party function, including the Get Together expansion that has clubs you can join. Dancing is hilarious.- Great expansion ideas, particularly having to do with environmental responsibility (but, there are too many expansions with too little content added to each one, so we're back to the money pit).- Lots have a vibe to them. You can choose mood characteristics for a lot just as you do for a sim, so a lot can boost a sim's progress in certain pursuits.- Cute little kids and pets (with an expansion) who show natural behaviors that are often funny and adorable.- A few convenient streamlining decisions. Your sim doesn't have to wash every dish in the house anymore, for instance, although it's weird to have god (you) just pick up a dirty plate and ghost it into the trash can in a game all about chores and self care.Pro/Con:- The new content has some fun little surprises that weren't in S3, but these are often pros with cons attached. The objects in the new version have some neat interactions, although some of them simply don't do what they advertise. Patchy the Scarecrow, for instance, hangs out and watches TV--creepy--more often than doing anything in the garden. If you don't want a pal from a slasher movie then you want to keep him locked out of the house. When you hire a \"professional gardener\" the expensive contract worker stops by, waters a few plants, skips five other things that could be done, then charges you and goes home. But the bird feeder is fun. - Too easy to botch a big decision. You need to be careful about how getting married works or it won't go as the interface implies with its vaguely-labeled choices. You might want to use YouTube or Twitch streams before you make any life-changing choices. I tend to micromanage my sims, so if you're fine to just watch the random behavior show and see what gets set on fire, then you'll like the autonomy on and the hold-my-beer nature of some of the commands.I'm saying \"pro\" and writing \"con\" here. That sums up the Sims 4. You get nothing without paying for it in some way. My hope is that in time I'll just memorize which moments of programming stupidity I can get around.Cons:Some of these are pretty big. Gameplay in S3 was slow because of bugs. Gameplay in S4 is slow because your sims are simply dumber than bags of hammers.-  I don't know who decided that you can play the bejezus out of a piano but cannot for the life of you feed your toddler on less than four tries and two hours of wasted time, but the most basic element of The Sims since its invention has gotten a little lost--time management. You can't just pick up your toddler and walk downstairs with the kid. Oh, no. Takes hours unless you pick her up, indicate where you want to put her down, do that, then pick her up again to place her in the high chair, which may or may not happen, before you give her a bowl of generic food, which may be too confusing for your adult sim who understands music theory to accomplish in less than an hour. The kid in the game will likely be more patient with this than you are before she disintegrates into sadness and fills her pants because her other needs depleted while you were hammering away at meeting just the one.A shower in this game can take all day. Sims stand in place or just do something else when you give them commands--that's with autonomy shut off. With it on they'll simply ignore what you want them to do. They collapse into instant mood meltdown because of a thunderstorm. - There are tons of options for conversation, for things to buy, for things to do. And you will not be allowed to do them. Fascists designed this game. You have to reach level 10 of some profession to get an item. You have to be a comedian in order to become a musician. You have to figure out some puzzle sequence of interactions in order to achieve something that should be simple. If you like to cook and let your sims eat what they cook, they will be fat. You have to work out like the entire cast of Guardians of the Galaxy, including Rocket, in order to just keep the basic shape your sim had in create-a-sim for long stretches of that sim's life. Your wardrobe is still limited by function rather than just listing all the clothing and letting your sim wear what you want the sim to wear (without using cheats). The controlling nature of the design does not make the game \"more challenging\" unless you consider standing in a bread line with your government-issued ticket a fun challenge. You have to find your fun in a more zen way, just watching the neat stuff the game actually lets you do when the programming doesn't get in your way.- You might like a game that works best only when you use certain cheats. I like a game that's programmed so you aren't constantly tempted to revert to cheats.- You can't decide how long you want your sims to live. S3 had specific numbers of days you could set for stages of life. S4 just gives you \"short\" or \"long,\" and you have to squeeze in what is sometimes an unreachable goal into a life. S3 did some of this, too--the architect career track, for instance. Sadly, S4 didn't solve some time management problems from S3 in a time management game. I have read that you will likely never reach the top level of running a veterinary clinic before your sim dies, no matter how workaholic your sim is.- S4 got rid of vehicles, which seems like another way to undercut The Sims rather than make it more... simmish. When you want to go to another neighborhood you just fade out and show up in some cloud of transcendental teleportation. There's a space ship. There isn't a junker for you to drive to work while you save up for the cool sportscar. Strange, and not cool.- The price tag. It's hard to say you'll be getting what you want specifically from this game for less than $75 beyond the base game, even at the sale prices. Wait for the packs to go to at most $7.99 and wait for the game to age a little more so that the $40 expansions cost $25 or so. - Origin. Does anyone like Origin? Is that possible? Origin is the capitalist goon element that EA never needed and that turns every experience into navigating a giant mall to find a restroom. When I load a game I want to play the game, not open the door to another Jehovah's Witness offering me another pamphlet. I paid my money, Origin. Get out of my interface.",

                "text": "tl;dr This review focus on DLC's because I think they are needed to make the game fun, but as it is now they are ridiculously expensive, so if you cant afford or wont support DLC's that cost twice of what the main game cost (which I totally understand), I cant recommend this game.I wont go deep into how Sims works, because the majority of people know how these games work and they are all very similar, one thing I will say though is that you should know that this game doesnt have open world like Sims 3 and the worlds are much much smaller, but I'll focus on content instead, Sims 4 is a decent game on its own but it can feel really empty, so if you are gonna buy this I would recommend you to pick up a few DLC's to go along with it, its expensive but its kinda needed if you want to enjoy it imo.I'll list a few DLC's i can recommend below but I can only recommend these DLC's if they are on sale (atleast 30% off) and I only recommend DLC's that I have played or know is good.Tiny Living Stuff: Let's start with the 'cheap' DLC, this DLC is fun and its one of the cheapest DLC's avaliable, it adds the possibility of building super small houses and use compact furniture, you can also use the items in this pack to build your own commune, since the houses and furniture is so compact that you could fit 5 to 6 houses on the same lot, all depending on the lot size ofcourse, but it makes this dlc fun and unique, I also think this dlc would fit well with the Eco Lifestyle dlc.Seasons: This is a good dlc, it adds 4 seasons with holidays and a lot of new items and things to do, it also adds new weather and ways to die. ( pro tip, you can kill your simmers really fast in a frozen pool ) Get Famous: If you care about fame and money get this one, its a decent DLC for its price when its on sale and if i remember correctly you need this DLC to become an Actor.Keep in mind though that fame is not as easy to get and keep as it was in Sims 3, in Sims 4 you lose it really fast if you stop working on it and from what I know it doesnt carry over to your kids if you decide to get those.Get To Work: This DLC is a must have really, it brings active careers to the game, as well as the option to become a store owner and hospital visits, its just a must have DLC.Cats & Dogs: This is the only DLC that I own that I cannot recommend, it adds very little beside cats and dogs and its so incredibly buggy, were Sims 3 Pets added Cats, Dogs, Horses and a few Small pets, this DLC only adds cats and dogs and then there is the vet business career thing, but I personally isnt that interested in that. Another thing is that I have adopted pets in the past and they always end up getting stuck and the simmers cannot figure out how to take care of them by themself, its really frustrating since they get taken away really quickly, there just isnt enough content in this DLC to justify the price tag.Final thoughts on the game, I do really like this game, its more alive in interactions than any of the other Sims games and the building and character creation is really user friendly, they made it so easy to use that everyone can make beautiful things no matter how creative you are.I'll update this review in the future when / if I decide to buy more DLC's, if you have any questions write a comment on the review and ill try and answer it.",

The Sims 4 is definitely not bad, but lacks a soul element. Most of the mechanics are still the same, or have been improved, but there are some weird choices (e.g. building a spaceship in your backyard) and some wackiness that seem too far off.That would be all okay though. What kills it, runs it over, beats it to a pulp, sets it on fire and then buries it in forty-five different graves is the business model of the game. The base price is 40\u20ac, currently with 45 DLCs, divided into - expansion packs = 40\u20ac each - game packs = 20\u20ac each - content kit = 5\u20ac each - \"stuff\" packs = 10\u20ac each(there might be some other BS I'm missing)The developers made it so that The Sims 4 has become more an online store for online furniture than a game. This is not acceptable. I believe that gamers should stand up and boycott whoever is responsible for this madness.

                "text": "After years of waiting Sims 4 is on steam finally. I've waited for this day so much. Sims 4 is a perfect game to relax or just failing at your sim life just like your real life. Or maybe you want to realize your broken dreams or deepest desires? Play it then.It's good old sims but unfortunately it has some bad old problems. Since the very first game I couldn't understand and it was annoying me badly, why the time goes so fast that you spend half of the day in the bathroom, making meals and eating. But this so far the only one significant negative point I could think of.Character creation is greatly improved. You have much more freedom to create your character. You can alter your body greatly, adjust the weight, lots of customization options and if you add mods you basically can create whoever you like. There's also gender options&preferences so LGBT people won't feel neglected here.You can also pick few perks for your sim, positive or negative it's up to you, your life goal, your temper and so on. There's a lot replayability value in this game due to how different your sim can be each time.After creating your sim as you already know you pick the house and start your life. There are life goals, job, relationships. My favorite activity so far is beating my neighbor every few days. I don't know why, anger issues probably.Of course most the time passes when you're at work and sleeping so just like in real life there's not a lot of time left for something else. Feeling tired and don't want to start talking with people? Go troll teh forums. Or give money to charity...which apparently was a scam. Then go outside beat your neighbor again and insult him. Then go play piano while other people do pushups beside you. Come back home call the girl, have some fun time, eat leftovers and go to sleep. Or maybe you want to live in a cute world by building your perfect house decorated with unicorns and rainbows?Ok lets get serious. The map is pretty small and while there's a lot to do and achieve there's still too little content. I kind of understand and agree with DLC expansions. This is not a yearly franchise, the game is supported for years so having DLC's is not a bad practice, plenty of very successful games do that and community loves them. They add content you might be interested and you're not forced to buy a new game each year. From seasons, pets to vampires. There's also some cosmetic DLC's which are not necessary at all. I love this DLC model but the problem with it is the pricing. DLC's a greatly overpriced. Yes it's good letting you choose what you want while supporting developers, but seriously these prices are insane. DLC's like seasons, university, pets should either be included in the game or sold at much lower prices. The ones like star Wars or Vampires are different thing, they feel out of context and more resembles real additional content. Not everyone is interested in those so it makes sense selling them separately and maybe at slightly higher price.There's a lot of dialogue options and actions so you can approach different people as you wish. Maybe there could be slightly more choices, but it's not bad.I don't know if it's just me but managing needs feels easier in Sims 4. In previous games I had problems with various needs besides bladder and hunger of course. Here I can easily keep my Sim happy.Modding community is HUGE for this game. There are really good mods out there, mostly cosmetic stuff but you can even mod drugs, violence, murder and sex of course. It all depends on your taste but I associate Sims with innocent and cute game for escaping the real world so mods like this seems out of place. But hey they are there and it could be fun from time to time.Graphically the game is wonderful. It's far from revolutionary on a technical side obviously, but it looks great for its art-style and overall aesthetics. Small details like emotions, food, your PC screen and other small things have enough detail.Performance is very good. It runs smoothly without any lag or stuttering. This was the reason why I couldn't play Sims 3, even after applying all the fixes the lagging was annoying.Ultrawide is supported out of the box. I'm playing on 3700x, 2070s, 32GB @3440x1440 and getting 90+ fps.Sound same as graphics is great. Talking is usual Sims blabbering in alien language which is really funny, but you can easily understand if the Sim is angry, happy etc. from the tone of his voice. There's also music. You can listen to radio or play music yourself. There are few genres to choose from but I miss metal of course and maybe more songs overall. Playing instruments sounds so good, sometimes I slow the time and just listen. Great songs there.If you love Sims it's obviously a good choice because there's simply no other game which would offer something like this. But the main game lacks content so you probably will need couple of DLC's to enrich the fun or maybe simple mods will be enough. Anyway at a sale price it's a no brainer. One thing i really wish and that would very simple to add are achievements, please EA do it.",

                "text": "The Sims 3 is also on Steam, and it's cheaper. Just something to consider. tl;dr: it's fun enough to be worth getting the base game and some expansions on sale, but, if you have the willpower, it's probably better to be a conscientious objector and not encourage EA's scummy practices by giving them money for this--although there are enough sim simps that I doubt your righteous protest will be enough to make a difference in the long run. Anyway,I'd recommend this one still if you get it on sale. The base game goes on sale for as low as $5 at times, and, while it's lackluster, it's worth at least that much. And the 2000 expansion, game, and stuff packs also get on pretty good deals sometimes. Even then, you'll still feel like you're spending too much money, but it won't hurt as much. The thing is, the game is fun. The packs are underdeveloped and overpriced, but most of them are still fun in their own ways. The devs really knocked it out of the park by making a game that's both so poorly-developed that it's infuriating but also still fun enough that you'll be willing to still play it and shell out money for at least some expansions out of the hope that they'll fix the game. The DLC model of the game is abysmal. So many of the packs are things that should absolutely have been in the base game or at least added as a free update--like Seasons, Get Together, Cats & Dogs, and Parenthood to name a few. Like, this game is all about interactions and relationships between people. They didn't flesh out the parent/child aspect of the game enough, and they want us to shell out an extra $20 for them to make it marginally better? Gtfo. The game is fun, and its vibrant modding community of people that love this game more than the devs makes it better, but it's also incredibly disappointing. I've gone back and forth on whether or not to recommend this several times just while writing this review, but I guess it's fun enough for it and some of its DLC to be worth it--if they're on sale, that is.",

                "text": "The base game is deplorable in the complete lack of content it brings, and is virtually unplayable by itself.  The game can however be really fun with the addition of a few good DLCs on sale and mods. Here are the ones I recommend vs. don't recommend having played with most of the expansions except eco lifestyle.  1. Sims 4 Get Together: The most underrated sims expansion pack. Allows you to create unique mini-communities that your sim would be part of, either it be family, or coworkers, or hobby groups. Super useful in everyday game play. I use it to make family gatherings, after work hangouts, holiday parties...etc. The groups also allow you to modify other sim's behaviour based on your expectations which really adds realism to the game play.  2. Sims 4 Cats & Dogs: Pets in the sims are a favourite of mine. Sucks that we don't have horses like the sims 3 but I am overall very happy with the cats & dogs expansion and I like the new vet career as well. 3. Sims 4 Seasons: Self-explanatory. Adds seasons to your game. Sims behave differently based on different seasons. Also adds holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentines Day etc. Highly recommend for varied game play. 4. Sims 4 Parenthood: Adds activities to toddlers, children & teens in the game. Allows sims to parent their kids. You can give kids chores, ground them, reward & punish them for specific behaviours etc and these actions will have impacts on your child develops. More importantly, this is a game pack so it is only half of the price of the expansion packs. 5. Sims 4 Dine Out: Same logic as parenthood. Allows your sim to eat at restaurants & also manage your own restaurant. One of my personal favourites. One of the better game packs. You can get a lot of hours out of this pack. Also super good for rags to riches challenges. 1. Sims 4 City Living: Allows you to live in cities and brings apartments to the game. Also adds various festivals to the game which are good outing spots. Really good expansion pack but ranked lower because I don't like how in the sims 4 they split sims 3 late night into three expansion packs - city living, get famous, and vampires. 2. Sims 4 Get Famous: Allows you to become famous actor, streamer & DJ. Adds new world which is equivalent to LA in the real world with gated communities and hot venues. Really enjoyed the actor and streamer careers and I think the concept of the pack is good. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed playing with fame in previous sims games. Again ranked lower because I don't like how they split one expansion pack into three expansion packs. 3. Sims 4 University: Allows sims to go to university. Not essential to game play since sim's don't really need degree to get jobs in the sims 4. However, it is well made and recommended for people who enjoyed the university expansions in the previous sims entries. 4. Sims 4 Realm of Magic + Vampires: Essentially EA broke up Sims 4 Supernaturals and sold them in individual game packs, which is good in my opinion because then you can just purchase the occult sims that you were interested in. The realm of magic and vampire game packs actually went into each occult sim (wizard & vampires) in more details that the Sims 3 in my opinion. Rank medium because I think occult sims are not essential to game play but they are really fun and I would recommend picking up these two game packs when you get the chance. 1. Sims 4 Island Living: Allows you to travel to the island world of Sulani. Adds mermaid to the game. In my opinion this should have been a game pack instead of an expansion pack. I am disappointed that they took out the resort management system that was in Sims 3 Island Paradise and I do not think this expansion much content compared to the other ones. 2. Sims 4 Get to Work: Adds several playable careers to the game including doctor, scientist, and detective. The careers are actually really fun, especially on the first few play throughs. The drawback is that the tasks gets repetitive after a while so I wish more variety was added to the mid to high stages of the career. 3. Sims 4 Jungle Adventure: Sims 3 world adventures turned into a game pack. Adds archeology into the game. Good pack but ranked lower because limited replayability and also doesn't appeal to everyone.  4. Sims 4 Tiny Living Stuff, Laundry Day Stuff, & Romantic Garden Stuff: The top of the stuff packs. Tiny living stuff because it adds interesting concepts & objects to the game. Laundry stuff because it was a community voted pack and the build items in that pack are awesome. Romantic garden stuff because it adds good landscaping objects. 1. Sims 4 Spa Day. Outdoor Retreat, Bowling Night: Will use once or twice. Not that important to game play.               2. All the other stuff packs and whatnot: $$$ packs by EA. Only recommended for avid fans of the series who have a lot of $$ to spend.                                                                                           1. Sims 4 Luxury Party Stuff: Almost $1 per item. Do NOT get unless you already got it. Ugly items that you will never use. 2. Sims 4 Strangerville: Not a bad idea but zero replay value once you've been through it once. Use your money on some other game if you must get it.3. Sims 4 Eco Lifestyle: Reviews have been horrible. There are many bugs reported online.  Community action plans are a HOT mess. Do not get it until EA fixes it.",

                "text": "This is a write up on what happens if you already own Sims 4 on Origin and buy it on Steam.= Installing =The Origin and Steam install are in separate locations so everything will have to be redownloaded.  Any DLC you've bought in Origin will appear in game (but not in Steam).  Oddly there's no download progress for DLC bought in Origin and downloaded with Steam.  It just states \"a background download is in progress\".  Also, Origin now shows me two copies of The Sims 4 - one version is normal while the other is marked as \"Steam\".If you want to go back to the Origin version just uninstall the Steam version.  Steam will delete it's installed copy of the game.  When you launch Origin it will think Sims 4 needs to be reinstalled.  Since the original Origin install folder is still there it will quickly verify everything and you'll be back to normal.= Running the Game =When you launch the game from Steam it fires up Origin.  When you launch the game from Origin it fires up Steam.  Even if you launch the Origin installed version of the game the Steam version supersedes it.  So if you install both an Origin and Steam version of the game it will always launch the Steam version.= Sales =The Sims 4 now has different in-game store fronts.  Right now there are no sales going on in Origin so that version of the game just shows all my unowned DLC at regular price.  But Steam IS having a sale so running that version of the game shows all the DLC at a discount.  I didn't buy any DLC from Steam so I'm not sure what happens with that.= Saved Games and CC =Both versions of the game use the same \"My Documents\" location for saved games and CC.  There should be no issues with that once all your DLC is installed.= Bottom Line =If you have any real investment in the Origin version then I'd say stick with that.  If you're new to Sims 4 then Steam is probably better.  The dual client thing is annoying since you need to wait for Origin and Steam to launch but Steam is the more robust client.  If the Steam version wasn't tied to Origin then I'd absolutely recommend dropping Origin but since you need both it's not worth the hassle to transfer to Steam.  Hopefully EA will get a clue and fully merge Origin and Steam accounts and just get rid of Origin.  The fact that Titanfall 2 bombed on Origin and is a huge success on Steam should be all the proof EA needs.",

Also, I'm not much of a gamer nowadays since I'm a father, having a job, and time is kinda limited to spend on my dear hobby. Nevertheless I felt obligated to post my first review because of this game. This was mostly an impulse purchase because, as I said, I did enjoy  1 and 2 and I have some money to burn, but I'm happy with steam and aren't that keen on installing other storefronts because of a game - though, when I started up the game and saw that you needed to install origin on top of Steam I thought, - Sure.. I think it's scummy that you need to install one storefront on top of another storefront just to play the game but, for this instance, I gave it a pass.I don't like EA. I haven't liked EA in a long while. I'm old enough to remember a time that when you saw that EA logo appearing on the screen you knew that  Wing commander, NHL 97, Syndicate, Budokan...  for crying out loud.. The list is long.So.Starting up the game went smoothly, as it should, and I thought that,  Went to the store to buy said DLC and I almost choked on my newly poured cup of coffee. Over $500!! effing USD to own all the DLC!??? That's FIVEHUNDRED US DOLLAROONIES!! And that is THE 30% OFF!? I could buy a freaking  for that amount! Needless to say, I uninstalled the game, the origin launcher and am right now demanding a refund. I knew that EA were scummy nowadays, but man. I just hope that the poor souls that purchase all the DLC actually can afford it and are not feeding their addiction with money they don't have. This is acting just as crappy as all the mobile gacha games that are overflowing the market right now, but instead of characters they offer you chairs, tables and pets. I'm honestly surprised that they haven't incorporated lootboxes at this point.  And this is having a  score on steam? I just shake my head...Good riddance*Edit* Forgot to mention. I would gladly pay $40-50 USD for a \"Complete Edition\". It's about time by now, don't you think EA?",

                "text": "The Sims 4 is arguably seen as the worst of the Sims titles. It gets a bad rep from those who prefer the previous titles. Let\u2019s jump into this further.Here are some features and game mechanics that people usually bring up and that I personally miss.The ability to change the texture, colour and material of surfaces and clothes for extended customization.Another staple in The Sims 3 CAS was the ability to tweak the colour of your Sim\u2019s skin and make-up to almost anything you desired giving you yet more customization and personality.This feature was a staple in the Sims series. It gave you the ability to move across the entire world, and see other Sims interacting with things around them. It gave the world more depth.In the Sims 2 and 3, you had a plethora of traits that you could assign your Sim giving them a more complex and realistic personality.This isn't really a feature commonly explored in the Sims series, but it was there in tandem with the expansion packs if you so wished to pursue.Okay\u2026so\u2026The Sims 4 has a few technical limitations and is missing some features from previous titles that we all know and love, but people tend to highlight the faults and failures and gloss over the positives. Here are some of my personal favourites.Sims no longer all look the same! Did you ever notice that Sims in 2 and  3* all looked a bit similar? There weren\u2019t many facial features or structures for you to mould to your liking. The new* click-and-drag feature in Create-A-Sim gives you so much more pliability and with preset facial features to play with, you can make something really unique. For further detail I would recommend watching Creating the perfect home has never been easier. It\u2019s now so more fun to build than ever, and with Build & Buy Mode merged into one it\u2019s a more fluid experience. For more detail I would recommend watching A new art style that I believe harkens back to the roots of classic style of The Sims. While The Sims 3 tried to go for the more realistic overtones, it didn\u2019t succeed very well and sadly stepped into the uncanny valley.Most* interactions are more believable. The new feature of being to multi-task is quite handy\u2026and while it isn\u2019t perfect, it still makes some* interactions more realistic and fluid rather than waiting for the next thing in the queue to happen.Unlike The Sims 3, 4* is extremely well optimized. I tested this on of my lowest-spec laptops and at maximum settings  it hardly dropped in frames.Granted 3* goes for the more realistic approach but can be costly.I think we should talk about the elephant in the room, and that is overpriced, overvalued expansion and game packs.EA have always made bad business decisions that have deterred their customers from this franchise. The one that stands out the most is the marketing DLC. In my personal opinion and the opinion of others, game packs are marketed at exorbitant prices, some costing even more than base game\u2019s value. Believe it or not, this is still an issue even with The Sims 3. Game packs don\u2019t seem to have decreased in value over the span of 12 years. This definitely threw me off initially\u2026but I\u2019m a sucker for interesting DLC.When disputing the bad business decisions, please do not confuse EA with Maxis. EA are the publishers and the ones in charge of business. Maxis are the true beholders of the Sims series. sadly, in some cases, publishers like EA turn games into cash cows and they become soulless corporate entities.After having played The Sims 4 for over 250 hours, I can definitely recommend it.I hope this short review helps you decide what to do,CeeGee.",

Overpriced DLCs with items that should've already been in the base game. 700$ on DLCs ??? No game is worthy of this price. This looks like a low budget video game in developing, not a well established EA game as it should be after 20 years since the first The Sims game. Very disappointing experience.",

(just be safe with those!)I like to go to ModTheSims for mods and to Carl's Sims 4 Site for the Cheats and Tips for gameplay. Both sites are loaded with information! MTS is also for previous versions of sims. :)You can record in-game play and hitting tab while playing will hide the HUD.The add-ons are outrageously priced as if you are buying a brand new game but, you are only buying an add-on. Once upon a time, when it was in stores, you could catch a sale that would be phenomenal but now that it's digital purchases primarily, they have found a way to control that? I miss those sales! I don't have everything for sims 4 but I do have about 11 worlds to play in and 3 world locations to visit. :) Quite a few packs and DLCs (I've about 13 left I've not gotten). LOL to buy the whole game it's over $500!!! If you wanted everything about this game, you could've bought a cheap real car. lol Or paid your rent. O.oIf you are considering this game. you can buy the main game here, if you own the game through Origin, and the packs can be bought from either. It was tricky but I bought just the base game and 2 EPs I believe it was. Then I used a Guide here on STEAM to make them linked. I moved all files over to STEAM so it's in one place. :D And so far it works great! The sales seem to be the same for Origin and here. I checked both during the last sale and it seemed the same.If you want a big hospital that is mostly realistic, works in game if you use freebuild cheat, check out my upload (Origin Username: XTSMasterID) I don't have a lot but I'm starting to share more. :) I follow for follow in there \u2665 As long as I know. But some are \"anonymous\"?? why? I've no clue.(The first Upload of the hospital, 2015)(I've a friend who tested this. Said it worked great for them as a hospital but you MUST use that cheat to make it work right)Please read other reviews for details and other perspectives. \u2665EDIT: It will not show your Origin hours, sadly. I have over 900 hours in this game but it only shows the base game for here and it's time.. Just head over to Origin if you own Origin and you'll see your previous hours there, as well as updated hours if you have the steam version. :) Origin should have all hours displayed though Steam only picks up when you buy STEAM base game.",

                "text": "This review is for those people wanting to move their sims 4 game across to Steam:There are plenty of reviews online about the differences between sims 4 and other versions, this review is for current sims 4 players who want to play their game on Steam rather than Origin.The first thing you'll notice is you have to purchase the base game A SECOND TIME in order to play via steam. Not. Cool. EA. I have moved games from different platforms to steam many times and it was always free, this added expense is unnecessary and outright stealing from loyal players. - so, I suggest you grab the base game on steam when it's on sale if this is still the rout you want to take.The process of transferring will require you to uninstall your Origin version of The Sims 4 and re-install a Steam version of The Sims 4 (still in origin). That's right, you will still need origin to play the game. If you were hoping to ditch the origin platform think again! - this makes it almost pointless purchasing via steam if you already have the game on Origin. For first time players of the sims however I recommend purchasing via steam, just cos steam is awesome! The Origin platform is less invasive when playing the steam version of The Sims 4, just sign in once to origin when you start up the game for the first time and from that point forward you may launch the game via steam and the origin platform will not be an issue. (allow your DLC to install before launching any pre-saved games or you may corrupt your saves (make save game backups b4 changing to the steam version! Just in case)) \u2013 your saves will be in exactly the same place as the Origin version of steam: documents/electronic arts/the sims 4/saves.On a positive note you will not need to re-purchase any of your DLC - thank you! thank you! thank you! I'm so glad they have allowed this. But I'm not sure any DLC will be purchasable via steam at this point, all DLC may need to be purchased via the Origin platform. so again, why bother getting the steam version of the game if you already have it on origin along with all your DLC?One reason you may want the steam version is to take advantage of the Steam Overlay. You can stream and chat with fellow steam owners from the steam overlay in game. (still not a selling point though since you can do just that by adding The Sims 4 as a non-steam game on steam\u2026 I think the overlay works when you do this but I\u2019m not sure), somebody please check and comment thanks!Another reason you may want The Sims 4 on steam is to take advantage of the steam achievements and badges. Yes, The Sims 4 on steam has badges! Go get your ranks up everybody!!I guess it all comes down to WHY you want The Sims 4 on steam, if you just prefer steam than by all means, get the sims 4 on steam, transfer everything across, Bob\u2019s your uncle. It supports the steam community, so if you do, thank you! If you don\u2019t have the cash to purchase the base game a second time than it\u2019s probably not worth it. If you don\u2019t care about steam achievements, badges or the steam overlay, it\u2019s probably not worth it. If all you want to do is uninstall the Origin platform and play on steam\u2026 well you can\u2019t, so get over it!IMO I got the game on steam because I like steam, I like being on steam, I\u2019ve always wanted to have The Sims 4 on steam, and I think EA have made a pretty good compromise here, they are giving us what we want but still getting what they want. (They probably just want more money \u2013 so long as Steam is somehow benefiting from this deal than meh! I don\u2019t care, I have the game on steam now, I\u2019m content).",

They've given you 24 colours for hair, no own colouring possible.The DLCs are all super expensive and I guess you would need them, because the vanilla game is pretty boring (but especially because they've cut the open world, I feel imprisoned in this game). You still need trash Origin to launch it (and no one likes Origin).",

Which takes forever.Saying all that, is it worth it? Personally, the reason I got it was because for the life of me, I could not figure out how to switch languages and as I love the sims, I wanted to use it in another language I'm trying to learn. Steam was able to let me do that finally and extremely easily! So far I'm really enjoying it and learning a lot. Also, I like the Steam interface and the befits of being able to connect with friends on Steam while gaming and I'm expecting easy mod downloads with workshop. Plus for future DLC, the sales definitely come to mind. I got the base game while it was on sale, and I think for me personally it was worth it, but just so you know, this is what transfer will be like. Might not be worth it for everyone.

Lately I checked out new early access game  which borrows some Sims mechanics and that was what reignited my curiosity after so much time.Many things have already been said about EA\u2019s greediness. I haven\u2019t seen this amount of DLC for any other game I played, especially not as overpriced. Good thing is you definitely don\u2019t need all of them. Many of the stuff packs is just minor cosmetics. As far as expansion packs and game packs go, below is an exhaustive list of essentials which will make your base game experience richer. Only first three are a necessity:Juggling between EA Play subscription, Steam bundle offers and major sale events (happen 2-3 times a year) you can complete your desired set much cheaper than the asking price. Other DLC can be looked into every now and then. It\u2019s definitely not needed all at once from the beginning.As a person who only played  back in 2000 I quite like this fourth instalment in 2021. I know it\u2019s already seven years old, and it took a long time for it to be where it is right now. Non-overwhelming interface, responsive controls, fairly big selection of build/buy items (lately Maxis added over 1000 new colour swatches to over 120 base game items). Game works great on SSD, GTX1060 and a five year old CPU. Steam integration is flawless, Origin starts quickly in the background and shuts down automatically right after you close the game. I could only wish for Steam achievements.I like that this game can be played in so many ways \u2013 shoutout to all you fantastic builders out there! \u2013 but also in terms of using/not using cheats or creating different starting scenarios. I like Sims\u2019 traits, aspirations and whims which add more to the gameplay. I very much like the inclusivity. The one aspect that surprised me the most in a positive way is gardening. I also love the overall sense of humour, not only in regards to gardening. How about growing that Cowplant, anyone? Or maybe a Money Tree is more up your alley, huh?Be warned \u2013 once you\u2019re hooked, three hours of your real life will fly by like an hour, and this is still an understatement. As for the product itself, choose your purchase timings wisely so you don\u2019t go bankrupt IRL. Happy simming! 8/10",

No. Is it the best optimized game out there (at least at the time of writing)? No. But what it does have is an amazing base game that's incredibly addicting. Even for the $20 its selling for, which in my opinion is a bit high, it's still a fantastic game that is incredibly fun to play with a group of friends.Obviously there's a lot missing here: private multiplayer, custom matches, the lack of maps, actually being able to use your own name (lol), and the crackdown on cheating (to be completely fair I haven't encountered any). If you're skeptical about the game, I wouldn't blame you for waiting for it to go on sale or waiting until more content is added. We've seen this song and dance before: games release with a bare bones experience that's wildly fun, but gets old fast. That being said, I hope the developers continue to make this game better and better. Cut them some slack too, they got flooded with a player base they couldn't have expected. Let them get back on their feet after the floodgates opened, and show us what they can do.Please keep going devs, I'm having a ton of fun so far but it's got a bit of a ways before it's really amazing. 8/10.",

                "text": "Fun in short bursts, tedious in long stretches (at the moment).75% of all the minigames need some sort of rework.Early game race maps need random factors to make replays feel varied and unpredictable while not being too punishing since they are the first levels. Survival games like Roll Out, Block Party, or Perfect Match need to always end based on eliminations, and they need to be faster and harder as right now they are so easy they are a chore.Team games are basically a random chance that takes 3 minutes to determine whether you won or not because your team's performance is irrelevant to your own individual one. Teams can also be uneven, making your random chance even lower. Fall Ball is also incredibly common because of it's flexible player count requirement, and I'm absolutely sick of this minigame. These are the worst and need to be their own game mode separate from the other game modes.Right now there are only 3 final levels, Fall Mountain is a race where more often than not the person in the lead stays in the lead because there aren't enough factors to mix up player positions. Royal Fumble is basically luck based depending on whoever in the cluster****  manages to grab the tail within the last 5 seconds. Hex-A-Gone is actually really good. Make these better by transferring survival games here and making them progressively faster until only one person is left standing. All these minigame problems could be alleviated by just having more games though. If you lose on a random chance you could at least look forward to what new games you'd play next round, but since things are repeated so often many of the maps feel like a chore. The number of levels increasing is likely to become the case as time goes on, but at the moment it Fall Guys biggest problem. Some kind of visual variety in the maps would be appreciated too. After 10+ hours of play the bright colors are all tiring and none of the levels stand out as very unique or creative.The game also has microtransactions which kinda inherently sucks, and there isn't enough of variety or customization options for costumes to really make you unique and stand out. Every Gordon Freeman costume wearer looks the same, excluding the face color, regardless of your pattern or color. Again, this will hopefully be fixed as more content is added over time.Most of this review sounds negative, but because of how much fun I had playing it and how much potential it has for the future I think this would be a good game to support and maybe play in moderation right now. If you think the repetitiveness of the maps will be too much for you then hold off for now. The goal is to have this review become outdated simply by adding a substantial amount of new minigames. If this goal is achieved I genuinely think this game might become one of my favorites.A more in-depth review that goes into every minigame specifically can be found here:",

I was a little reluctant to get involved in a Battle Royale style game as I generally suck at competitive play but the sheer gleeful hilarity of this game more than makes up for the frustrations.Are there server issues? Sure.Are there filthy filthy cheaters? Oh you know it!Am I still terrible? Hoo boy am I ever.Is it filled with bright colours, upbeat music, snappy mini games and lovable characters all bumbling their way to victory or slime?  Yes, yes it is and I love it.+++UPDATE+++So now I've played for, gee forty hours, seriously?  In that time I have managed to win two episodes.  Bear in mind I am terrible.  Two victories out of hundreds of failures.  Sweet sweet victories.  This sounds like a pretty bad ratio but really each victory feels truly momentous especially considering the ever increasing number of cheating hackers.The cheating was something I could overlook when it was rare, but now it is the norm and it is really making me lose interest.  This is supposed to be Fall Guys, NOT Fly Guys.  There is very little competitive edge when you know the dude who is hovering above the level is going to automatically win!  I am now at the grinding stage just trying to collect the rest of the cosmetics for the season.  The initial shine has definitely dulled, and unless Mediatonic add some kind of anti cheat, this is going to quickly lose the large casual audience.  We shall see what Season 2 brings, but if the hackers are going to be allowed to continue operating I don't see myself joining the ranks of hopeful suckers never able to get a legitimate win.===UP-UPDATE===So now I'm deeper than sixty hours in and Mediatonic have indeed listened to the criticisms levelled at their tiny little behemoth of a game.  There is now an anti cheat running in the background, which I know has been a bone of contention in some other releases (hello DOOM: Eternal) but it was desperately needed here and to be fair, I haven't happened upon any filthy dirty hackers since.  So now I can get back to being terrible through my own volition.There has also been a refreshing of the levels.  A remixing of sorts.  The old tried and tested games have been given a lick of fresh paint and are all just a little bit different.  Clockwise rotating beams now might rotate anti-clockwise.  Wrecking balls that swung along the x axis now might swing along the y axis.  And there are random spinning hammers all over the shop.  It has definitely breathed fresh life into the game and really all my previous complaints have now been addressed.Jolly well played there chaps.  Good form indeed.Right, I'm off back to my glorious upbeat technicolour failure...",

                "text": "Update 9.19.20 || The devs have addressed the cheating issue and have finally added EAC, which has helped to alleviate the cheating problem. I'm still going to leave this review as it was at the time that I wrote it to stand as testament to how terrible this game was on release. I still don't recommend this game. I have zero faith in these developers. The anticheat took far longer than it should have to be added and all the other issues with this game still remain unaddressed. PS, usernames are STILL disabled. I'm pretty confident the developers have no intention of re-enabling them. RIP grabbing ttv streamers, it was the only truly fun thing to do in this game. //This game's launch has been an absolute trainwreck.THE GAME RUNS ENTIRELY CLIENT-SIDE, which means people can blatantly speedhack with no special hack tools. The game also has NO ANTI-CHEAT, AT ALL. The closest thing to anti-cheat is a single text channel in the game's official Discord where you can manually report cheaters, which, surprise, doesn't actually get any cheaters banned. Users were able to use HTML in their Steam username to make their names appear large or colorful in-game. I never once saw this used for anything malicious yet the developers went nuclear and decided that, RATHER THAN FIXING the html injection, to just force every single player's in-game name to \"Fall Guy ####\". WHY NOT JUST FIX THE HTML IN USER'S NAMES. Let me give your programmers a hint, it's called input sanitization, you can look up a tutorial for it on YouTube and actually do your job.So with those two problems coupled together, yeah let me just go and file a report against someone with nothing but the username \"Fall Guy 1234\" to go on\u2014I can't even track their Steam account through recent games. Keep in mind also that this game has a million-some players and there are only 4 digits in each randomized name, so there are going to be several dozen duplicates of each numerical name. The devs couldn't track that to a player even if they wanted to, so no one is getting banned for cheating. Great work guys. It's only going to get worse as the game goes on if nothing gets fixed. This game has the worst netcode of any game I've ever played. There's a gamemode that involves running around the map and stealing tails from other players. This minigame was copy-pasted twice to make three equally garbage modes, I've heard dozens of complains against them from friends and streamers and I don't think a single person actually enjoys playing them. Enemies with Walmart parking lot tier internet can grab you from over 10 feet away and when you attempt to grab the tail off an enemy you can see the grab icon pop up on their character and nothing happens 50% of the time. It's so inconsistent that there's almost no skill here, just pure luck. Nobody enjoys the forced team gamemodes either. You only have a small amount of control to the outcome of team games, so winning equates to a simple game of luck based on how bad your teammates are. In addition to that, this is a physics-based game, using Unity's default physics engine. It's horrifically inconsistent and sometimes your character will simply trip over their own feet, falling down and losing the game because someone grabs your tail while you're on the floor, or you jump down a level on Hex-a-gone and your character simply trips for no reason and you fall to your death while you try to stand up. The physics make the game feel horrible to play. Half of the minigames feel like they were quickly thrown together in the last 2 weeks of development to meet quota. Especially \"Perfect Match\", the game where no one ever dies unless they're literally afk. Only *one day* after releasing, the game's servers completely died, for absolutely everyone, for almost an entire day. They had previously been dropping constantly in the middle of games. The devs' had presumably been attempting to migrate their servers to a different host with a larger capacity, but apparently failed to do so and were being very secretive as to why. They had announced a maintenance would begin at 6:00 am, but randomly decided to begin six hours early at peak player count time and gave no ETA for when it would be finished. The \"maintenance\" ended up taking almost the entire day and no one could play the game the entire time. When the game first officially released they deliberately avoided announcing the time that the game would unlock. They also avoided notifying players when the servers were back online after the \"maintanance\". They clearly knew the servers would choke on the first day and didn't fix the servers in the three day period before the game launched, or, you know, several months before, they had ample reason to predict this would be a problem but did nothing.  My favorite part of it all is that the developers are BLAMING THE PLAYERS for their problems. On Twitter they blamed the players when the servers went over capacity, clearly their fault, and they blamed the players when users used html in their names, also clearly their own fault. Fix your game. The game has a separate Twitter account for the server status. Not only has the account constantly lied about the status of the servers, in addition to claiming they \"would tweet when the servers are back online\" and then didn't, I thought it was pretty hilarious that the main Twitter playfully posted something along the lines of \"Look how many people are following our server account!\". Yeah, no, they're not following that because they want to hear your awful hello-fellow-kids tweets, they're doing it because they want to know when the servers are going to be back online for the game they all paid $20 for.  The devs had MONTHS to beta test this game and somehow bafflingly didn't catch on to the fact that the servers wouldn't have enough capacity to handle the amount of players on launch. Or fix the broken netcode. Or add anticheat. Or fix html in usernames. Or rework the bad minigames. I refuse to believe this kind of stuff wasn't caught in QA, which means either there was no QA, or the devs just ignored the feedback.  I've never seen a company shoot themselves in the foot and handle success so poorly.And to the people claiming that this is excusable because \"they're just a small indie company\", it isn't, because they're not. They have 230 employees and have existed since 2005. This is pure incompetence. I don't see this game lasting past its first season.",

It's a cute battle royale which I haven't had the pleasure of playing since Mario Party or something like that.  Every woman, man and his dog already knows about Fall Guys so let's just get down to brass tacks.__________________+  Fun with a capital F.  Everything is colourful and playful and when I played each time the servers were pretty fast.  +  room for improvement.  We are in season 1 now and I hope that next seasons come with new maps.  There is a huge window of opportunity to keep the game fresh and therefore the play-count high.  The devs are going to have to really focus on this aspect because at 60 players per room, that's a helluva goal to set to keep this game alive.  But to be fair when you have a bunch of seasons of Wipeout and Takeshi's Castle to draw from for inspiration then we are all set for a few years I think.+  maps.  There are a lot of maps but I haven't experienced them all yet in my 4 hours.  Some are better than others but everyone will have their own preferences.  Some maps are hectic scrums, others require a bit more platforming savvy techniques, others yet have a more physical dexterity aspect.  There is something for everyone.+  microtransactions are purely cosmetic and offer no bonuses to the players.  There are a bunch of skins you can buy or grind out using the in-game currency, Kudos.  But there is nothing I can see that offers a speed or jumping bonus, etc.  Just MTX to keep funding the game once saturation of the player base has been reached, I suppose.--------------------------  names.  EVERYONE has a username of fallguy XXXX where X=numbers.  I want to put my own name in there.  I want to see my friends I am playing with.  I want to know that b'stard that pushed me off a ledge.  -  controls.  The controls seem a bit too sluggish for me.  Changing direction or trying to grab something can feel like you are doing it through a pool of syrup.-  hackers ruin everything.  I have only seen a couple but they are out there and they are x10 faster than us, they begin before the starting gun fires, they jump higher and further than us and it is zero fun watching them take the crown.-------------------------Fall Guys is a blast.

                "text": "There's no doubt Fall Guys deserves every ounce of the hype it's receiving - the game is ridiculously fun and an absolute blast to play alone or alongside a handful of friends, easily knocking Gang Beasts and similar titles off of their pedestals.I trust Mediatonic will listen to the outcry for new levels, balancing, and content... but Fall Guys  inevitably get repetitive and boring in the long run. For this reason, I encourage them to say attentive to community feedback and not fall into the void of trend-games; to do so, Fall Guys could follow in these three steps:To begin, there's clearly a few minor issues with the game that most people are reporting across all platforms - notably regarding team games. Working together to complete objectives is fun, but individual skill currently holds no weight when qualifying for the next round.Solving this is straightforward; team games should stay, but players may individually qualify throughout the round if they score enough points or hold the objective for enough seconds. Playing team games during a semi-final is very disappointing, since it's hard to shake the feeling that you may not qualify for the finals due to a rogue teammate.Aside from team games, the majority of the minigames are hilarious, but I really hope that we don't have to wait for the end of the season for new maps. Seasons are around 60 days long which concerns me since there's a chance that we'll be in the same rotation of maps for another 2 months.Undoubtedly, the most obvious way to maintain an active playerbase is to add new maps and skins, but this option can only be done so much before stagnating - I really want to see Fall Guys reaching the numbers it's doing right now around this time next year. To do this, Mediatonic need to be actively innovating and bringing in new features beyond the base game. Examples include:Doubling the party size would be a great first non-map/non-cosmetic update - this currently being the main barrier holding back a few of my friends from buying, since our group cannot fit in a single party.Controlling your Fall Guy is genius in its simplicity. Jumping, diving, and grabbing seem basic on the surface, but play a huge role in finding shortcuts, eliminating other players or getting a final boost of speed before reaching the finish line. However, as there are still many unused keys on both keyboard and controller, it'd be great to throw in an extra move or two.One idea may be a high risk, yet high reward 'punt' button, allowing you to kick over a nearby opponent after a few seconds of charging up. However, missing a kick would cause your character to tumble forward, leaving them at risk to obstacles or other players.Counter-Strike's War Games and Fortnite's LTM's opened up a new market for developers to satisfy niches in their audience, but tend to be stale and unexciting after a while.Rather than sticking to the cookie-cut format of scattering limited-time modes throughout the year, Mediatonic could innovate by claiming a specific day of the week, introducing a unique spin on the entire game for 24 hours. '100-player Fridays' may be feasible; a once-a-week alternative to standard 60 player matches, containing exciting minigames tailored for larger groups alongside prodigious rewards for those who secure the crown. Providing the community with interesting spins on standard gameplay in small but addictive chunks may assist Fall Guys in moulding into , gradually shifting towards a lifestyle game that keeps people coming back to play week by week.Streamers will often return to games that enable them to play with their community, or host games such as 'Marbles On Stream' allowing active viewers to compete for personalised gifts such as a paid subscription, shout-out, or merchandise. With minimal crossover in this niche already, Fall Guys has an opportunity to grant streamers the ability to open a private lobby - rather than compete for crowns, viewers instead join through a room code and compete for a predetermined prize at the discretion of the streamer.With a mixture of luck and commitment, Fall Guys could become a smash hit, continuing to flourish over many years. Without getting too ahead of themselves, Mediatonic could consider opening their game up to the Steam workshop later down the line so players can upload their own maps and modes for approval. This way, Fall Guys is never short of quality content and unique ideas for the years to come!To summarise, Fall Guys is awesome yet still has legroom to grow even bigger and better. In spite of expected day one issues, Fall Guys is far from being just another washed up gimmick, on the exception that Mediatonic really knuckle down on content and balancing  the first season ends.I strongly recommend Fall Guys and wish the very best for Mediatonic moving forward!",

                "text": "I've spent a ton of time playing this game, so I want to do my best to give an honest review of the game and do it justice.A basic explanation on what the game is, would be a colorful and eye-popping battle royal style game that includes a multitude of different rounds to play - including solo race rounds, puzzle rounds, and skill based rounds. Team rounds are also a staple of the game play, pairing you up with random players in your lobby to work towards a common goal. However, there is only one crown, and therefore can only be one winner! In some cases there can be multiple winners, but for this to happen you have to have cooperation with the rest of the lobby and some skill in order to time out rounds.The game play feels choppy at times, is the best way I can describe it. The crowd physics in the game, regarding interacting with other players through running into their character or grabbing them for different purposes, has from day one been an ongoing issue. While some games you can play with no issues and great server connection, other games will have you frustrated, especially in game modes requiring the grabbing aspect to either steal tails, hold Pegwins or trying to fight back against someone trying to grief you. I feel like it'll forever be an issue in the game, because the problem seems to be much deeper than just a simple patch can fix. I understand that this issue can be a deal breaker for new players, and I want to reiterate that it will become a problem for every player at some point.For a game that looks colorful and fun and simple to play, there is a strong competitive player base that makes the games much more difficult for unsuspecting players. There are some people who will be able to pick up the game quickly and roll with the punches, but for most players there is a learning curve involved. I'm currently, as of this review, still under 600 crowns in total with 900 hours of playtime. I personally enjoy playing the game with friends, however, and spend a lot of time in game modes such as Squads Show and 2-3 man squads. This isn't a game that I think you can solely play competitively, and if you're going to continue coming back to the game you should find a way to have fun while playing! That can be any reason - grief other players, play with friends, or helping other players win. There's an amazing scene of streamers and players on Twitch that really got me hooked on the game, and I encourage anyone looking for other players to check out someone they like on that site! Personally I recommend DjBigRuss and CrazyyTrainn, but there are plenty of people to chat and play with!Overall, it's a game - there will be plenty of people who enjoy it, and many others who dislike it. There's plenty of players online however, and finding a match doesn't take very long at all. With all the different levels and variations of those levels, along with an interactive media team and a development team that brings new content to the game as soon as they can. I recommend giving the game a chance at some point, if you're not willing to spend $20 for it then wait until it goes on sale. It's a wonderful game and I've met some wonderful people I don't think I would have met without this game, and it'll forever be a game that I have a ton of love for.",

You can earn in-game currency, though, but it requires a bit of grinding on the player's part.I'm really looking forward to future updates as it desperately needs some more variety regarding maps/gamemodes if it wants to keep being relevant.

The gameplay is fun yet slightly challenging and the different courses are very reminiscent of those TV shows I used to watch as a kid. That said though there are a limited number of courses you can play through and though fun for a while they get old very fast, after about 2 hours I had seen every course in the game and after playing the same courses over and over again, sometimes back to back, it started to become a drag. All in all though I still recommend Fall Guys for when you have a few spare hours to burn or for when you're with your friends and wanna get a quick laugh.",

                "text": "Fall Guys, as a concept, is a wondrous spin on the battle royale genre we\u2019ve seen in recent years. My woes, however, stem from what I\u2019m assuming is a dev team that\u2019s trying their best with a playerbase they never expected. Let me preface by saying that I am absolutely in love with this game, it\u2019s probably one of my most favorites to come out in recent years. Solo matches are what I do to turn off my brain and relax for a bit. Playing with friends can lead to many laughs and wholehearted fun- but... only when it works. This is where my first problem stems: Matchmaking into a game when queued with others on my friends list can be super dodgy. We get matched into different games from each other entirely, some of us just drop out of our team in the menu completely out of left field, or there will be a hard disconnect while we\u2019re playing in an ongoing match. I do note, however, the disconnection issues have gotten better since one of their season 2 patches, so I thank them for that.Another lingering issue I have is that ever since the mid-season update during the first season, one of my friends has been falsely flagged for cheating ever since EAC has been implemented. He has exhausted every option to get a concrete answer as to why they\u2019ve been banned since then, only to be told that they -won\u2019t- reverse it and won\u2019t even tell him why he was banned in the first place. I KNOW he doesn\u2019t cheat. This is the same EAC that\u2019s used in games like Rust and Fortnite, and he can still play those games at full capacity.No mention of what program it could\u2019ve been, no real explanation... nothing. I\u2019ve been unable to play with my friend for the longest time and it makes me both upset and sad that this is still going on. So... if you\u2019re dealt a terrible card like he was, good luck! Because for some reason they won\u2019t tell you why or how you got banned. That\u2019s money down the drain. No chance at a refund if you\u2019ve been playing for awhile.My second most frustrating ordeals are when I see Mediatonic tout brand new variations for maps that a small group of players have said are too easy/boring when adding spinning pillars or hammers should be -last- on their list. Players being bored of a single two-minute match is a non-issue. Players can ABSOLUTELY handle a dry spell of the same map if it means that the devs could spend time and resources fixing prevalent bugs that have been in the game since day one.Some bugs and issues I can remember off the top of my head:- Broken hoops in the hoop games where you successfully jump in them and don\u2019t earn a point-Grabbing the crown in Fall Mountain only for the grab to not register at all, so you fall and someone else grabs the crown. Sometimes I would literally be dangling on the crown because I haven\u2019t let go for a good few seconds in hopes that it will register my win, but then someone else runs in and gets the win instead-Falling in-between the middle of three hexagons in Hex-a-Gone because the velocity messes with your bean, thus falling onto the levels below, or just getting eliminated immediately into the slime-Jumping on a \u201ccrack\u201d between two adjacent platforms in Jump Showdown and having my input get eaten, so my bean just simply doesn\u2019t jump and I get swept away-Minor (but annoying) issues like where my bean will be placed if I fall in a weird zone during one of the gauntlet levels (ex: in Whirlygig with the middle shortcut with the fan at the end, if you fall in a very particular place surrounding it, the game sets you up at the very BEGINNING of the map. So trigger zones or respawn placements really desparately need to be looked at.)I don\u2019t want to leave a negative review because I know game dev work is a lot. I\u2019m leaving one (and hopefully, just for now) in the hopes that this gets read and passed along. Your playerbase doesn\u2019t need new big yeetuses, it needs answers and relief from some of the bugs that hinder the very core of your game on a near-daily basis. Us players can wait for new mechanics and silly shenanigans, but everything I listed above is also just some of the several handfuls of bugs and problems I\u2019ve encountered so far, and I know I\u2019m not the only player with these issues. A quick look on the most popular Fall Guys subreddit will show you similar complaints, too.I\u2019ve amassed many hours into this game and probably over 90-100 wins currently, so know that my issues come from a place of wanting to see this game thrive. I adore Fall Guys, you have something lovely in your hands, so all I hope is that you devote some love back into the facets that need it most right now. As much as I want more people to get into this game, it\u2019s hard to recommend it in its current state. While I may be patient with its many bugs and disconnects, there is also many others who will leave the game flat because of it.You can do better, just by re-focusing on what\u2019s important. I hope I can change my review in the future, but please, I hope this all gets heard. I wish Mediatonic the best of luck.",

The winner is determined by 3 types of mini-games: race, survival and team. Each next task depends on how many players are still competing. You can run, jump, do a racing dive and grab - that\u00b4s it. As in real life everyone lives out their character. You will be pushed into the abyss, jostled, attacked by teams and finally mocked before the finish line. Please also welcome the fraudulent plague of the digital age that is literally flying over the cuckoo's nest. And ultimately the game physics, based on loss of movement control, ensures mass collisions and gives you the rest.In a nutshell: 60 beans line up, one wins.+ Takeshi\u00b4s Castle style+ play with up to 3 friends+ quick matchmaking+ fast games - max 15-20 minutes to the crown I didn\u00b4t get once+ rumbling jelly beans+ hilarious fun and absurd situations+ free season pass+ customization - costumes, emotes, victory poses etc.+ more hilarious fun and even more absurd situations+ watch remaining players after reaching the finish line or even when you\u00b4re out+/- easy to learn but(t) hard to master - did I mention I never got a single crown?!!+/- monetization for cosmetics and the game currency Kudos+/- your starting position can make the small but subtle difference, rotation makes it fair+/- after 1-2 hours you know all mini-games, but more are announced- There\u00b4s nothing really negative to say about Fall Guys. Yes, there are cheaters, but show me a multiplayer game where these dishonorable beings don\u00b4t show up. And yes, the unexpected success of Fall Guys initially completely overwhelmed the servers and you still may experience a disconnect or lag here and there. So what, go for the next round. Unfortunately there is a trend for negativity in reviews and forums these days because people have neither understanding nor patience anymore. And in the end all depends on how developers communicate with their player base and solve problems. They did a great job so far and seem to really care about their game.Absolutely! It\u00b4s screamingly funny and the first so-called Battle Royale that I enjoy. No ranking lists, no weapons to master and in lack of a chat no russian pet names for your mother. Fall Guys definitely is the multiplayer feast of this summer that nobody expected. So join the party or be a party pooper.",

And holy cow this game is amazing, for how colorful and quirky the characters look.I been addicted for 2 days now and I'm still going so there might be something wrong with me lol..Overall I can see myself spending hours upon hours playing this game and it looks like the game will always stay updated for new maps and costumes for your character. The physics and and the jumping and bumping against each other is hilarious to see. The competitiveness is definitely there for a battle royale and your always wanting to play \"one more\" after you finish your game and then realize its freaking late as hell and you have work in the morning LOL.10/10 will fall onto guys forever!!",

Even as a new player, after a few games you will be repeating events, after about 10 games you will have experienced everything this game has to offer.- Starts to feel a bit repetitive after about 1 hour (in my experience)- In-game cash shopOverall, is it fun? Yes, for a limited short time.  With the current amount of content available within Fall Guys, I would have priced this game at around $5.  If they decide to add (A LOT) more content later on, than perhaps this game is justifiable at $20, but currently I wouldn't imagine playing Fall Guys for more than about 2 hours.*Voted Positive, because the game is truly fun, and I don't want to bash it just for the price*",

                "text": "Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout touts itself as a fun battle royale style type of gameshow with both single player and team match modes. The fun stops there though.This game employs a (horrible) EULA and Privacy policy that seriously should make you question intent.The EULA states, amongst other things, that you give the game company a world wide license to them and their partners of any content you, for instance, stream or upload somewhere. In other words, they're free to benefit from, for instance, a review or impressions video you make of the game. Furthermore, the privacy policy logs all your interactions (in-game actions and what they call \"patterns\") by posting data to them. The info they collect may also be shared with third parties like holding companies or other business entities to name a few. You can read them both  and .This is just a tip of the iceberg. They also collect personal data about you from third party platforms you use, i.e Steam or Playstation. I've rarely seen such anti-consumer agreements which completely engulfs whatever privacy the user have left into oblivion. You can't opt-out of it either. Data collection is nothing new of course, same goes with games installing software you absolutely don't want on your computer (denuvo and easy-anti cheat amongst others). Most people sadly don't care, but for us that do this is important. Fall Guys is by no mark of the mile unique - there are many other games on Steam that carry this practice. This is about taking a stance against anti-consumer behaviour and giving a straight message to the game companies what they're doing is not okay - one game at a time.If you want to play Fall Guys you must accept . Some people may be fine with this, but I am not.",

                "text": "as much as I enjoy the game Its just rampant with hackers. The discord removed the report hackers channel because they had \"implemented their anticheat\" which if you read on their website, once they activate their cheats they're flagged. \"The likelihood is, if you saw a cheater, it was their first and probably their last time cheating - they tripped our anti cheating switch and the next game they have been detected.\"is what it says on the support website.  I got the same hacker twice in a row, I know this because they had the exact same outfit as before. I'm not good at writing reviews and this is more of a grievance thing.  On top of those problems are the latency issues when you get grabbed or pulled 3 fall guys away (I'm using fall guys as measurements.) and they quickly run off with your tail and you're unable to catch up with them. Also momentum seems very inconsistent, at times I'm moving at the same speed as another person coming in my direction and I'm suddenly pushed away with quite the force that knocks me down. other times people are flung at me which causes me to fall on stages like block party.At the end of the day sure its a game to just have fun but with the hacking happening and other in game shenanigans it makes it less enjoyable. As for if you want to report a hacker, here's the link to the fall guys support page about hackers.Edit: As of August 24, I've encountered strange incidents in game. During Rock 'N Roll I was on the red team and blue had already got their ball in. Red and yellow got the balls in at the same time and I was eliminated. It showed a random blue player winning the crown.Another incident was during Fall ball and the score was 0-0 as both teams were actively defending their goals, it went into overtime and not 10 seconds after that the whole yellow team was eliminated. I have sent a support ticket to find out what this is all about but I doubt I'll hear back from them. I just want to know what the mechanics behind ties and stalemates are because for the last one it just seemed like they picked one team to eliminate and moved on.  I never encountered this during the beta so I'm mostly curious.",

                "text": "I'll start off with saying this is FAR from a bad game, and definitely has potential to be a great and fun experience, but right now it just has some glaring issues that really put me off from playing more than just a few games, I heavily encourage you to look up more reviews and gameplay to decide if it's something for you but here's what nags me personally;Right now it's difficult for me to really keep going as you keep seeing the same maps over and over in just a few hours of playtime, and most of these involve running forward from one end to the other before X amount of players do, with the inspiration this game draws from Takeshi's Castle this is understandable, but I feel like more could be done in this regard to make the average game more varied.Generally I enjoy the game in short bursts, but I have absolutely never enjoyed any of the team games, it honestly just feels like a 2 minute wait to roll your 66% or 50% chance to not be eliminated, this isn't helped by the fact teams can be uneven in terms of player numbers and objectives spawning at random in some of these minigames, I really wish there was an option to opt out of these.This is entirely subjective, but I hate this, of course there's skill involved but winning is mostly a random ordeal from my experience, yet there's time-limited cosmetics you can only obtain by winning 10 or so games, quickly shifting the focus from lighthearted fun to just getting annoyed if you don't get the crown should you be interested in any of those cosmetics. I really wish there was no arbitrary time limit on these things or another way to get the currency so you can steadily progress, the pressure to win is something I don't enjoy in a casual party game, of course reward the winner but please don't lock things solely behind winning games.Currently there are 3 minigames for the final round to decide the winner, two of these feel utterly pointless to me as one of them is a race, but you spawn in 2 rows, if you don't spawn in the first row you've generally lost from the second it starts. The other game involves holding an item when a timer runs out, which generally just results in running in a circle for 2 minutes, only to end up in a clump of people for the last few seconds, mashing the grab button and praying you have the thing when the clock runs out, which is more frustrating than anything. The third game is one I actually enjoy where you need to move across disappearing platforms in multiple layers to avoid falling down, the last one standing wins, this doesn't feel as random or reliant on luck and makes for a much more fun experience, I hope more final minigames follow this trend.All that said, I'm still excited to see where this game goes, as new maps and minigames are already planned, and I'm already very close to recommending the game.",

I can't wait for bug fixes, hack detectors, and new levels!\" It took a month after launch to release anti-cheat. It wasn't until season 2 that we got new levels. Four of them. None of them finals. Even worse it wasn't until halfway through season 2 for bug fixes to actually be applied. Now we're at season 3. What should be a major return to form for the game. The levels are uninspired. The new opener is nice, sure. But Ski Fall is the most broken game produced so far as you can just race down three times for 3 quick golden rings. Why bother playing the round as intended? I haven't even seen that grab the penguin game because apparently they want to push a rock and roll variation on us.  And the two new finals are literal reskins of two existing games. We got Hex-a-gone but smaller and roll out but smaller. Inspired. I enjoy and appreciate the free content, I do- but what's the point when all it is doing is making the game worse?? The sad fact is that this was supposed to be the season release that pulls back in all the people that quit this game. I've said it before and I'll say it again. This game won't be relevant come 2021. Mediatonic stumbled onto a gold mine and didn't have the means to capitalize on it. It's just disappointing.",

Stumbling into cheaters that make the game worse for everyone is becoming increasingly frequent and it can't be solved by simply stating that \"if you meet a cheater, this is likely their first and last time cheating\". If you play 10 games and meet 10 different first-and-last-time cheaters, you'll still have 10 games ruined. Do better, Mediatonic and Devolver.That said, the game itself is brilliant in its simplicity. The idea is quite straight-forward\u2014a battle royale game based on the Takeshi's Castle formula, easy to access and fun to play both for less-experienced and hardcore players, it still requires a bit of strategy to master all the different events. Most of the mini-games are polished and fun to play and are varied enough to keep the game fresh during its first season. It's yet to be seen how Mediatonic will handle the following seasons and if they'll mange to introduce enough modes and events to keep Fall Guys entertaining, what we've seen so far about the medieval theme for Season 2 seems like a first step in the right direction.A must-have game for everyone... except for those who fear they'd have their 'hardcore gamer' license revoked, I guess.",

                "text": "Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is a battle royale game where the player must guide their character through a series of events inspired by TV shows like Takeshi\u2019s Castle or Ninja Warrior. Starting with 60 players in the match, roughly 10-15 players will be eliminated each round until the match ends with 1 winner.There are lots of different events in the rotation so you won\u2019t see the same ones in every match. Some events have players competing individually while others divide the players up into either 2 or 3 teams, with everybody on the losing team being eliminated.Some events are races, where the player must jump over bottomless pits, avoid obstacles such as swinging axes, balls on chains and spinning blades, and cross the finish line as quickly as possible. In other events you have to score points by jumping through hoops, carrying eggs to a nest or pushing giant balls into goals. Or you might just need to stand on a platform while hazards try to knock you off. In some events, falling off the level will let you respawn at a checkpoint and try again, while in others, falling into slime results in instant elimination.This is the first game I\u2019ve played in the battle royale genre, and I\u2019m enjoying the challenge of trying to get a win. I\u2019d imagine most experienced gamers will find the first couple of rounds fairly easy to qualify from, but in the later rounds with only the best players remaining, it can be tough. I\u2019ve lost count of how many times I\u2019ve finished in second or third place.If you\u2019ve watched your favourite streamer play Fall Guys (there was a time when pretty much everybody on Youtube was playing) and get annoyed by other players, I can confirm I know exactly how they feel. There\u2019s nothing worse than somebody jumping into you just as you touch a bouncepad, causing you to fly off the level at a random angle, or when somebody grabs you for no reason (like, on a race event where they\u2019ve got nothing to gain because it slows them down too), or when you dominate a team event but your team loses anyway. In most events though, its possible to recover from a couple of errors and still qualify, and being the last person to qualify for the next round feels great.If you make it through to the final round, a complete match should take around 20 minutes to play. You\u2019ll earn a couple of types of currency based on how far you survived, which lets you unlock some wacky cosmetic items. In 20 hours of gameplay I haven\u2019t noticed any bugs. The physics sometimes feels a bit random but I think that is intentional because its a weird gameshow. Controls feel fine on my Xbox 360 controller. The art style is colourful and the music for most rounds is entertaining.Fall Guys is a fun (and occasionally annoying) game to play if you\u2019re looking for some wacky multiplayer action. Don\u2019t let the art style fool you, it gets quite competitive in the later rounds. And there\u2019s enough content and replayability to justify the price.",

Especially the last update introduced so many new bugs that it's just not fun anymore.-insane amounts of bodyblock-you get thrown out as a squad although you actually had the position to qualify-you don't get thrown out but still don't spawn in the next roundthe playerbase isn't doing the game any better either:-grabbing can ruin your round completely while you can barely do anything against it-in squad rounds there are always guys waiting till the last second to reach the finish so you have to wait like foreverAll in all a once great game that has gone downhill recently. I just hope they're gonna improve on some of that stuff, so i can enjoy it again.EDIT 05.12.:With the new season updates, a lot of the bugs from above were fixed (crossed out now)Idk what exactly was changed about collision and stumbling, but playing just feels smoother again. It was an update for the better and i have now changed my review to positive. Also the new levels and skins are great.However, there are also bugs in this update, the two most notable are the Kudos disappearing and randomly changing numbers and that you can bug out the pipes that are new introduced and then be stuck till the round ends. I hope they are fixed soon!EDIT 22.12.:The bug regarding Kudos is fixed and I haven't seen the one with the pipes in a while either, so good job an that!Also i found out more about the bug where the squad is thrown out: When several squads tie on the last place for qualification, only the one that made the points first is gonna qualify, as if they were not tied.",

                "text": "While Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout isn't nearly as popular as it was around the time it launched, it still remains a perfect video game for what it sets out to accomplish. Its presentation, gameplay, low skill floor and price tag make it accessible to anyone who'd want to give it a try. If you're looking for something refreshing to play with a group of friends, even those who might not be big on video games, then look no further. Gameplay-wise, it is the best Wipeout or Ninja Warrior game (n?)ever made. You know, those shows where people have to beat an obstacle course in order to win the prize money? Here it\u2019s a bit different, with up to 60 players thrown into a match, consisting of several rounds. At the end of every round, those who fail to complete the objective in time are eliminated. Not every round is an obstacle course however, but can be anything from a vast plethora of minigames spread into six different categories. For example, Race rounds will always task you with reaching the finish line of the course before a certain number of players manage to. Survival rounds will require you to not get eliminated before a certain number of players does, or a timer runs out. These are then further differentiated by themes and obstacles. One Survival round might have you balance atop of an ever-moving platform, dodging projectiles launched at you, while another will place you in an arena with three giant Rhinos attempting to knock you out. Team rounds, which require you to work with random players towards a common goal to prevent your entire team from being eliminated are all about scoring points, but can either be a game of basketball, football (the soccer kind) or collecting as high of a number of eggs as possible. In the main game mode, a match must always start with a Race and end with a Finale \u2013 the most suspenseful, final round of the match, usually a Race that only one player can win or a Survival round that keeps going until the last man standing. Other game modes, both fixed and rotating, focus on specific categories or levels themselves. There are also custom matches you can make for you and your friends.Even if all rounds across a category follow a certain pattern, none ultimately feel the same. Additional obstacles will sometimes appear on maps they were previously absent from, so the game can still throw you a curveball even when you think you have them all memorised. Still, some are clearly better designed than others. Door Dash, a Race round, is a course consisting entirely out of doors. Some of these are openable, while the others aren\u2019t \u2013 with there being no way of telling between the two until you try going through them. It almost completely eradicates the momentum of the match. If you go for an openable door consistently enough, you\u2019ll qualify. If you don\u2019t, tough luck. Other levels that solely consist of multitudes of the same obstacle have a similar effect, though none are as bad as Door Dash.The controls are quite tight due to how limited they are. You can jump, grab (players, ledges, objects and some objectives) and dive, so the game requires a total of three buttons to play \u2013 excluding movement. A controller is ideal, but the keyboard and mouse perform almost just as well.Progression feels good, but it could feel better. Winning a round will net you a Crown, the game\u2019s \u2019\u2019premium\u2019\u2019 currency awarded solely through wins or milestones in the current Season\u2019s battle pass-like progression, called Fame levels \u2013 limited to 50 per Season and increased by XP, which is awarded for each match you play. Each Crown you acquire also increases your overall player rank, which awards you cosmetics upon leveling up and is separate from your Fame level. Besides Crowns, there are Kudos, a second currency awarded at certain Fame levels, as well as upon completion of a match regardless of whether you won or not. Kudos can also be purchased through microtransactions, in bundles as costly as $50, more than twice the game\u2019s price. While the game isn\u2019t by any means stingy with its rewards, the progression does feel a bit staggered and the inclusion of microtransactions can\u2019t help but make me think of some marketing analyst or currency designer figuring out how to optimize it best to incentivise a purchase. Even when they aren\u2019t intrusive, they\u2019re there for a reason.Your rewards can be spent in the store for cosmetic items. Some cost Kudos, some cost Crowns. There\u2019s a fixed number of items that can be displayed in the store at a time and they reset once a day. Simple as. Customization options for your Fall Guy are quite varied and some visually striking combinations are possible, even without playing much.Visually, the game is a colorful joy to look at, with the audio making it all the more appealing. The Fall Guys make cute \u2019\u2019oofs\u201c and other sounds when they collide with each other, and scream of excitement when an obstacle launches them into the air \u2013 all of it heightened by a groovy, bass driven soundtrack. It just oozes fun.Performance wise, the game ran great on max settings, at a steady 60 FPS. However, the animation LOD distance wasn\u2019t that great, as players and obstacles further away would be running at a notably lower framerate. I don\u2019t know if this is simply the way the game\u2019s optimised, or something affected by the limitations of my specs. Weirdly enough, the game would sometimes drop down to 30 FPS while waiting in the lobby or the post-match recap. Reviewed on the following system:While the game\u2019s current player numbers are a far cry from what it once had, it still maintains a healthy population, both on Steam and outside of it, thanks to cross-play. I wholeheartedly hope that Mediatonic can keep Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout in such a state, as it\u2019s a fun game that truly anyone can play. Even if you don\u2019t end up winning, the little animation your Fall Guy does during the post-match summary shows that he\u2019s had a lot of fun even participating, just as you will. Here\u2019s to hoping it can keep going strong in the years to come, at least as long until there\u2019s a worthy successor.",

                "text": "So I started playing 'Rust' at 4pm yesterday.Within 3 minutes of my first time playing, a bear ate me. Then I watched two other players club each other to death with large stones, while completely naked, penises (penii?) dangling in the wind. Having managed to slay a small pig, I fashioned some clothes to cover my genitals, then went exploring.Ate some uncooked meat and threw up all over the place. Made a small fire to cook the rest of my meat. Fashioned a bow and arrow out of some wood I collected, also a shirt and a pair of boots. Went about fashioning a small shelter out of some random crap laying around so I wouldn't have to sleep outdoors. I could have chosen from one of the many, many, ramshackle structures dotting the landscape. But those may or may not belong to/contain other players. Who may or may not be armed or clothed. I just wanted to peacefully live alone, so I stuck to the wilderness.I slipped off a cliff and broke both my legs. I shouted out to anyone who would listen, asking what to do to fix my broken legs, I didn't understand the game and I needed help. A naked man came over, typed '??? i help' in response to my pleas, then bashed my head in with a rock and presumably looted my corpse.Then I starved to death when I forgot to eat. Out of desperation I butchered a wolf that attacked me instead of running away, but didnt have time to cook so I ate raw meat again. Nope. Instead of just starving to death, I vomited, then starved to death.Its now 7:25 am and many adventures later, I've decided to sleep in a small shack I made myself in the mountains. Don't dare risk making a fire, someone might see it at night and kill me for the tin of baked beans I got off a zombie I found wandering around a town that gave me radiation poisoning. Oh yeah, I'll probably die slowly because of the radiation, but thats a problem for later-me.In a tiny hut on a mountain with my sleeping bag and meager belongings after 12 hours of playing straight, I can probably safely say I'm enjoying this game.",

                "text": "I used to have a simple review for this game, titled \"Best Game.\" But as my time playing it comes to a close, and I start to sell off my skin inventory, I feel it necessary to give this game what it has given to me over these past few years.Rust is a game like no other. Sure, there's plenty of survival games out there. But this game stands apart from the rest in ways I can't explain. The amount of friends I've made, enemies I've made, bases I've made, bases I've destroyed... The amount of times I've been in massive PVP situations, defended my base from a raid, woken up to be offlined, rebuilt... The feeling of having AK less than an hour into wipe on vanilla, of \"dancing with zergs\" as a solo, or being part of a massive clan with friends. The stories I've created... The stories WE created...Rust is a game of stories. Stories you, your teammates, and your enemies make day in and day out as you work together or compete to not only survive, but thrive. I've played rust for nearly 3 years, and it's the first game I ever truly got hooked on. I'm sure one day, maybe even only a month or two from now, I'll be sucked right back in. I love rust for the difficulty, for the challenge, for the building, for the adrenaline pumping PVP I've never experienced in any other game. This world will be hell when you start off. It's cruel, and it doesn't give second chances. But as you play more and more, and gain experience, learn the game's unique PVP and your way around the monuments... You'll find yourself gradually getting better and better. Whether it be building, like it was for me, or PVP, or even roleplaying, you'll find your place in this world.Saying I recommend purchasing this game isn't enough. I can only convince you so much. So the choice is yours... Will you write your story?",

                "text": "After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote \"Sorry guys :D\" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be \"shoot-on-sight?\" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. All in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.",

If you like building a great base and only fighting other players in specific areas, there's a server for that. If you like fighting off zombies while never having to deal with getting raided or offlined, there's a server for that. The graphics are intense and visceral, yet also beautiful, while the crafting and building are pretty intuitive once you get used to the system. For your first run I would suggest a specifically newb friendly server until you get used to things, otherwise it will just be lots of dying and rage quitting and you will miss an excellent survival shooter.",

I do not have any food or shelter yet, however, I was able to obtain a few logs by hitting a tree with this rock multiple times.. What a mysterious island.I have found a chicken, some more wood, and a few stones, I was able to conceive an amateur, handmade axe, it only took a few seconds to make, so I was able to kill the chicken too. I have also gathered a fairly large pile of wood, I might be able to build a makeshift shelter, but for now...Tonight I feast.Today is the day, I will finally build a shelter, I can feel the warmth of a warm bed and fire already. I haven't felt this good since I was a child, playing with my toys, I remember one toy more than most, it was called a \"Steam\", ahh, the good ol' days.I will be home soon. I promise.I'm sorry.I have killed a man.It all happened so fast, he was holding a gun, I was debating on making peace with him, but he seemed the brutal sort.And all of his gear, it was... Enticing.He must have had a family, but I am becoming selfish it seems, I don't care about the man that I have killed.All that I can think of is one thing, not my family, not his family...But tonight I feast.I've come across a small, abandoned town, there seems to be a lot of loot within the area.The only problem is that I obtain a heavy dose of radiation if I go into the barriers.I have a choice: Obtain what's necessary to survive and die from radiation, or live on how I am now.. In poverty.I think I'll live.Just for a while longer.I saw a man today, outside of my cabin, he was naked and he had a rock.. He seemed to have been yelling incomprehensible jibberish, he must be insane.. I remember when I was like that.I still am in a way.I don't know what to do.The man that I saw yesterday came into my cabin while I was asleep, he held a rock to my head and struck..My life flashed before my eyes, stupid reflex, I grabbed my journal.Remember when I said that I was coming home? Sadly my dear, you'll have to meet me in heaven.I am bleeding out. I am in god's hands now.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",

I have watched a bunch of naked men with rocks rove the hillside in search of the \"clothed\" and kill mercilessly. I have watched people come together over d*ck paintings they created together. Sometimes you will join a server and there is a small group that take everything and leave nothing. You might even be taken prisoner or trapped and then taunted until eventually it is too much and you give up on life. Much like real life there are good people and bad people. If you take games too seriously, you won't enjoy this. This is survival of the numbers and occasionally survival of the most clever. Never give up, never give in, it all starts with a rock.",

                "text": "_______________________________This game is a great example of a survival sandbox game. You can literaly do whatever the hell you wanna do. Do you wanna roleplay? Go for it. Do you wanna build stuff and let your creative mind blow of some steam? Go for it. Do you wanna murder another player in cold blood with your trusted rock? Go for it.Obviously there are populair ways (PVP) to play the game but when you spawn in this game.. naked and along on a beach.. armed with a rock and torch.. with nothing holding you back.. you will realise why you woke up on the beach in the first place._______________________________At the time of writing this review i've been playing this game for years. It started out with a mate of mine buying the game. I was watching him through some streaming software and I thought it looked fun. So I bought it.After figuring out the basics of crafting and resource gathering the two of us started building a wonderful base. That base lasted for a full hour. Then we were severly punished for the flaws in our design by a more experienced player. This happened over and over and over and over again. At this point a lot of people lose interest in the game, I didn't.For some reason I was determined to learn from my previously made mistakes and improve on them.This resulted in over 1800 hours of gameplay. 1800 of GLORIOUS hours. But like I said earlier, this game isn't for the feint of heart._______________________________When you invest a little into this game physically and emotionally.. you will run into people referring to \"Legacy\" being the best state of the game, I disagree.The current version of Rust is a combination of two previously tested systems of the game.These are named: .Most Rust players will tell you that the blueprint system was the best system this game has ever seen. Over the last few years them tried different systems which generally didn't get any love.A week ago (at the time of me posting this review) They revamped the system to the one I mentioned earlier. - Aka the best system Rust has ever seen + new features of older failed systems revamped.______________________________________________________________Well, sorta. If you take a look at the facepunch website you will be able to see a roadmap. On this roadmap you will be able to find features and fixes they lined up for the game. Some will be added shortly and some will probably never see the light of day. Keep in mind the game is currently still early access and might change drasticly in a year. I've seen the game go through 3-4 different systems now. And all of them had fun aspects and negative ones._______________________________If you are still interested after reading all this, definately buy the game. Over the years of me playing Rust, I've had the most interesting interactions and the most fun experiences ive ever had in a game._______________________________I'm working on a really big tutorial for this game. So if you are interested in that.. please check out my profile and subscribe to my youtube page. If not, I hope this review helped you a bit. Im not a professional reviewer or anything of the sorts. I'm just giving you my two cents about the game.",

I yelled at him as loud as I could, and he turned around. We greeted each other, and agreed to work together.After a few days, we'd built a house, and had enough supplies to last a week. We had weapons, food and water. Life was good.One day, on our daily raid, we spotted someone. He was naked, and ran towards us. He greeted us, we greeted him back, and he and I started a conversation. Suddenly, my friend pulls me back and whispers to me. He said we should kill him. Survival of the fittest.I looked back at the innocent man and gave him my pickaxe and told him to leave. My friend sighed, and gave him some clothes. He thanked us, and left. The next day, he appears again, to say thanks, and that he has a gang as well, so that we could join him. We kindly refused. He sounded a bit agitated, but he said no problem, and left.Later that night, I hear footsteps outside our house. My friend was fast asleep, so I grabbed my homemade shotgun and looked outside.It was the man. The man who we gave a pickaxe to. He was inspecting our house with someone else, but quickly left after he saw a bear running towards him.The next morning, I woke up my friend and told him what happened. He told me I shouldn't have trusted him, and that war is coming.I was raiding an old town, when suddenly on top of a hill in the distance, I saw him. Although this time, he had his gang. There were a lot of them. About 10-20. My friend noticed this as well, and told me to get inside. We got inside, and it was quiet for about an hour. My friend and I go outside, and see them waiting.They said that they were friendly, but we didn't trust them. My friend and I got out our shotguns and told them to leave. They didn't listen. Then the war began.They got out guns and shot at us, firing at all directions. My friend got hit, and yelled at me to get inside and lock the door. My friend barely got inside, but when he did, it was already to late- they were inside.Luckily, we had a panic room for this kind of situation. It had an iron door, which could only be broken down by C4. We rushed down there as the scavengers began to search our house.After a few minutes, they'd discovered we were in the panic room, so they began swinging at it with the pickaxe I gave them. It didn't work. When suddenly, I heard a boom. They had C4.My friend and I discussed what we should do. We agreed that when we get taken hostage, we run like hell.They eventually got in, took all of our gear, and we were naked again. They were about to execute us when suddenly, my friend got up and began to run. He ran as fast as the wind would take him. They missed every shot they took at him, so I decided I had nothing to lose, so I ran as well. It was pitch black outside. I felt around and felt a bush, so I hid in there. In the distance, I could see torches everywhere. My friend saved my life, but the enemy was searching for him. There was nothing I could do, so I ran off, and began my new life.To this day, I don't know what my friend is doing. Dead or alive, he's a hero. The enemy army got raided by an even stronger group, and me?I'm surviving.Stories like this make Rust such a good game. It truly is an experience. I highly recommend this game. Although the glitches are a bit annoying, you get used to it.9/10",

He helped me out since I was a newbie, he fed me chicken that came from a cow, sheltered me in a wooden house that I couldn't escape from and he protected me from the wolves I tried to pet. Once I finally understood the game, he released me into the wild, I took a few steps into the open and BOOM I got shot in the back by him. I respawned at camp and beat him up with a rock, took his stuff and ran off happily ever after.10/10 MUST BUYEDIT: The man has captured me once again, but this time, my knowledge has advanced. I entered his fortress willingly, but little did he know, I was an evil mastermind. He took me as one of his \"crew members\". Along with 2 other people, we journeyed and raided other buildings. But slowly I stole gear from their base and soon, equipped with full kevlar and a bolt action rifle, destroyed their sleeping bags and once again killed them all. I ran away while holding the V key (in game chat) and played the TROLOLOLOL song. I ran off into the sun set and went offline to write this update.",

There are a lot of responsibilities you have as a rust player and it will be twice as easy and twice as fast to do it with a duo partner.: You will die with all the loot in the world, many, many, times. Even more so if you try to play solo. I don't want to say solo is impossible, hJune shows us that, (and lots of other rust youtubers) but for new players its a no go.: The people who play the most have the best results. As in a person who plays 10 hours a day, everyday, for the entire wipe, will get much further than someone who plays a couple hours a day. If you don't have lots of time on your hand to play, I wouldn't play at all.: With any game, there is a fairly toxic community. Half the fights you win with a gun, your opponent usually makes fun of you for how many shots you missed and how much gunpowder you wasted, but I find this funny.: Mostly on offical servers, so i suggest for you to play on community servers such as solo/duo/trio. Only problem is community servers die quicker than official servers.: Once you learn the ropes, it becomes a really fun game with intense moments and great fights.",

Overall, if you have the money, i'd suggest looking into buying this game. It is currently in Alpha, so really look into it before purchasing. 60/100",

There is no narrator or announcer, so instead you submerge in the quietude of the unkempt grass crunching beneath your feet, as you uselessly smash your rock against the nearest pine tree. Perhaps you've also harvested some mushrooms and a few bundles of flax; enough to stave off the hunger pangs and fashion yourself a burlap shawl to cover your shame. If you're particularly industrious, you'll have furnished a nice wooden shack a stone's throw away from some fresh water and reliable resources\u2014the entry-level homestead necessary for any successful Rust campaign.But then you hear it. Faintly at first. Carried on the tip of the breeze. It's another idiot in Rust. I don't know what it is with this game. Maybe it's the fact that you spawn unclothed and uncensored, maybe it's the brutal vastness of the design, or maybe it's the simple uncouth joy of doing bad things to other human beings, but Rust has a distinctly regressive effect on the human species. The voice chat merges with the draw distance, so when you're spotted by an idiot, you'll start hearing the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665-talk quietly tickling your ear. They get closer, they get louder and more confident, and suddenly you're hopping over shotgun shells while absorbing an entire dictionary of insults.It's so hilariously antagonistic that I wish I could say I didn't love it. I wish I could say that it didn't feel incredible when one of those naked idiots charged me with their rock and I switched to the battle axe I fashioned out of scrap metal (which he almost certainly didn't know I was carrying), and put him down with a single well-placed strike. I wish I could tell you that, as I was standing over his fatally wounded body, that I didn't laugh my ass off when my headphones were filled with the voice of a prepubescent boy shouting, \"Hey man, wait a second!\" I wish I could say I didn't kill him anyway. No game has ever indulged our lack of humanity quite like Rust, and I wish I didn't mean that as an endorsement.",

As per EAC's totally 100% accurate system, I was using \"3rd Party Software\" (on my own community server - a server where I'm the admin... and owner... which btw already contained all the admin tools I needed to assist in identifying hackers). I appealed () but was told that they (EAC) are totally 100% accurate, I was a bad boy and the ban will not be lifted. I contacted them again but received no response. I contacted Facepunch  and was told that they totally trust EAC's totally 100% accurate system and to get lost. I have sent EAC numerous emails, logged a number of tickets... and even created a Reddit post (which the admin quickly deleted) and they still refuse to investigate my case. It's now 240+ days since my ban and I've officially given up! I've lost quite a few bucks on this game; skins, 3 (or more) gifts, two community servers...

                "text": "Rust, Rust, Rust, where do I begin. Would I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you know what you're getting yourself into.Well, first off, Rust is a game of \"Survival\". But their definition of survival is... well... different. To be bluntly honest, the nature of the game encourages and rewards you for being an absolute \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. For a game that plops you naked on a beach with nothing but a rock, there are alot of guns and powerful weapons players can get easily and very early on. The game appears to cater to clan and group wars, which I'll admit, makes for some excellent videos. But the fact of the matter is most people (myself included) don't want to play that way. This game becomes a HUGE investment of your time as typically, it will require hours to build a \"raid-proof\" home. And once your home is finished, you'll look out at the beautiful sunset and log off, confident your hard work has paid off, despite the fact that your home is only 30% actual home and the other 70% is pure armor. But when you log in less than 24 hours later, you find yourself waking up on noob beach. Because for every hour you spent building your home, some prick has spent double that left clicking the attack button with one hand while furiously fapping with the other to wreck your hard work. But if you can manage to build a good home on a good server, the game can be a very rewarding experience.Rust for me had alot of disappointing, infuriating moments, which often keeps me from coming back to play. But it also had alot of great moments. The act of logging on alone was an anxiety, waiting at the loading screen wondering if I've been killed or if I was still safe. The intense feelings of paranoia from the presence of other players and of protecting my home. The adrenaline rushes of being shot at, and of going on intense raid missions. The excitement of assassinating a powerful kingpin (who deserved it) or gunning down a warring maruader. And finally, the feeling of looking out the window of my beautiful home at a beautiful view of the sunset or a full moon on the ocean. A game has never before invoked as much emotion out of me as Rust has.I would reccomend these tactics for staying alive:- Play \"Native American\" style. Plant your sleeping bag in a bush where no one will find it, and live a life of very little materialism. If you die or are robbed, you lost very little- Hide. Build your home where no one will find it. Consider sacrificing a fort for a smaller home. It will be easier to raid, but harder to find. Raiders will assume there is a bigger bounty inside a bigger fort, but might decide not to waste their time on a smaller home because they'll think you're poor. Stay far away from the West and East coasts (where new players generally spawn), away from the middle of the map, and away from the road and rad towns. Build next to clusters of big rocks, or terrain that would be unappealing for travel (for example, tundra), and never in the open. You will likely be found eventually, but I have had games where I was either never found or if I was, players just left me alone. And it will give you lots of time to estabilsh your hold. - Play the game RIGHT after servers wipe so that you're the first person to start on a brand new island- TRUST NO ONE. You may find players that will like to trade or who will actually help you. But always practice your politics very carefully. Most players will shoot you on sight- Get a feel for the population of the server. I usually go to servers that appear abandoned and play alone for quite some time. Sometimes it works, sometimes the server suddenly becomes popular. You can refresh the server lists to constantly know how many people are on a server at all times. On rare occasions, you can find servers where the strongest players are friendly's who will actively hunt the kind of people who seek to ruin your day. You can collaborate with these people- Understand raid tactics. You can lock your door, but can they blow a hole in your window? Come in from the roof or the foundation? Did you destroy the stairs so no one can get up to you? Did you build a third floor in case they blow up the first floor ceiling? Did you armor the hell out of your cupboard so they can't build their way around? There are lots of things to consider, and the game is constantly updating in ways that require new strategies.- Raid a few homes yourself. I'm generally a peaceful player, but if I see someone setting up camp too close to my territory, I treat it like a threat. Because let's face it, it generally is. The players will eventually find your home if they haven't already, and you can't trust them not to come after you. Again, you can check the servers for population and you can scope out targets to determine if the player is currently online. Exploit weaknesses, get in, loot, and get out as fast as you can. Know how long the travel will take and take advantage of things such as the cover of night. Stay out of the road and weave through trees, bushes, and etc. Make sure no one sees you, catches your name, and make damn sure you aren't followed. Good luck and happy hunting",

Pros: -Great game for friends to play together. -Building mechanics -PVP & PVE (though its annoying at times)-Good graphics that were just updated! Palm trees look great.-Server versatility (Official, Community, Modded) gives multiple playstyles.-Amount of map variation. -New content regularly. (Electricity, Hot air balloon, Minicopter, New weapons)-Active Devs. -Community (Also a con) You can meet some pretty cool people on here. Ive made a few really good friends. Cons:-Solo can be a struggle for a lot of people. Especially if you arent a PVP god. -Bugs still pretty common. Some that can ruin a wipe or hours of work if they happen at the wrong time.-The devs priorities seem to be a little off of what the community is asking for. Instead of optimization and PVE   improvements (the aimbot scientists), they have been focusing on new content which creates more bugs. -Community - Almost as toxic as League of Legends. Racism runs wild even though most of them are literal children who   think they are being \"edgy\". Even the people that arent toxic are just intentionally annoying (Just dont keep your volume   all the way up if you want to have eardrums when you are done)Despite the cons I honestly believe the Devs care and will address the issues eventually. And they are doing a really good job of keeping the game interesting and fun.",

                "text": "Before I start I would like to say on my old acc, I had about 2000 hours on rust and I have been playing since it first came out, I also will be merging my old review from a while back with a new one, enjoy.Rust is a game that delivers as a true survival experience. In Rust you may choose to play alone or with others to survive, build, and loot. The game is at its best on its community servers as the official ones tend to be overly crowded and very intense for a beginner. In Rust you spawn in a random area of the very large map with nothing at your disposal but a rock, a torch, and bandages (Depending on the Server). With that rock you begin your seemingly overwhelming journey of gathering supplies, supplies allow you to create tools, and buildings. From there most players choose to explore their surroundings and upgrade their defenses.This game while enthralling is a time consumer and requires a lot of your attention, other players can kill you and loot your corpse. I've spent hours upon my intitial spawn working in a community of players building a small city and upgrading to metal walls. We traded supplies, hunted together, looted nearby rad towns, and even slowly accepted new players into our ranks. Our small group had become a society, we aided those who needed help and defended our small city from other players masked as bandits. We had come to know each other by first names and trusted that our things be safe while not ingame, as there was always another player on watching over your city.This game is perhaps the first game to create a challenging but engaging true to life experience. Things I had never experienced in a game before such as trying to decide amongst your fellow founding members if the lone newbie could be trusted behind our walls? Do we let him in? Should we make him bunk in the Newbie quarters overnight until he pulls his own weight? Are our walls truly safe? Who should be allowed to carry rifles? How can we expand our society and truly be able to keep our loot safe? All of these questions come into play at any given point.Play with the right people, on the right server, and you too can have this experience. As for that society? What led to our unavoidable demise? One lone player trusted behind our walls was able to level everything in just a few hours. That is part of the game though, that experience, is what defined for me what games should be aiming to deliver a one of a kind experience I can experience nowhere else.Your experience may vary, your story may differ, but mine definitely enables me to recommend this game to the average player.If you enjoy working hard at something, having a totally different survival experience, definitely buy this game.RUST is the best PC community game I have ever played.This game is the truest test of character I've seen in no other game before.. Some days you will meet the scummiest, most foul, and toxic players/people. They will make you want to quit playing, and they will ruin your day. BUT for every one \"P.O.S.\" you meet, there are three wonderful people & potential teammates just waiting to cross paths with you. I have met and made some great friendships from this game, that have carried on to other games as well. This game can open new doors and opportunities. I went from being a solo player on RUST, to a Leader of a 50+ player gaming clan & Discord server where we play a variety of other games. You get whatever you put into this game. It can be time consuming and frustrating. It will either pay off, or it won't. That's RUST for ya.Now, I suggest you start with playing the game the way it was intended (vanilla), not because it will make you better at the other versions/servers, because it won't.. It's just to get you used to the grind. getting used to the grind will make modded servers much more loose and fun to play on. Also, if you advance pretty fast in Vanilla, you will advance much faster in Modded. That being said... People who play *only* Vanilla servers, and those playing *only* Modded servers are an entirely different breed. Being great at Vanilla, and making \"plays\" left & right, DOES NOT mean you can do the same thing on Modded servers. So don't puff your chest too much and walk into new territory thinking your hot stuff, cause you can easily get made into hot dog crap by players who know the play-style of that server far better than you do.This game is easily 10/10 for me.There may be some bugs, but they end up being more funny than annoying in my opinion.The Developers are SO AMAZING. they releasing free updates monthly, they do seasonal/holiday events in-game, and they have been making DLC for those who like to Role-Play as well. They feature content in community-updates that showcase artwork, Youtube videos, and idea's by players just like you. This game is so great because they listen to your feedback and implement changes or content into the game based off of what the community wants. Going as far as putting a trumpet in a turret. (Turrrumpet! - Shadowfrax) It's our game, they are just making it for us. LOLYoutube videos are a great way to help you get situated and will help you better understand the game if you want to know more about it.If you're looking for tips on building I suggest Youtubers: My Gaming Experience, & Evil WurstIf you want to watch good players fight and try to survive I suggest Youtubers: Blooprint, & Jordan RantsIf you want to watch seriously great scripted stories set in Rust, I suggest none other than: Frost. (<--Seriously amazing)If you want to see Craziness and the Hilarious insanity of RUST, I suggest you checkout: Mr Memio If you want to keep up-to-date on everything RUST, subscribe to: ShadowFraxI wish you good luck on your travels! I'll see you in game, and remember..RUST Karma is *very* real.",

                "text": "After nearly 3,500 hours I finally decided to review one of my favorite games on PC. In fact, it was the reason why I bought a gaming PC in the first place.Pros:- RAIDING - Raiding other groups, clans, or enemies provided me with many hours of tactical, engaging, and intense fights. It is one of the core aspects of the game, and is what kept me hooked for so long.- PVP -Rust is one of those rare games that gets your heart rate pumping after killing a couple of enemies, and trying to loot all of their bodies while zig zagging your way to safely deposit your loot back home. All while your hands are shaking.- BUILDING - The way that people build bases is constantly being changed through certain forced updates. You used to be able to build huge castles and compounds, but now the game has switched to a more bunker base style build. This change in style every once in a while is refreshing in the form of you aren't seeing the same base build over and over again from YouTube tutorials.- ROLEPLAY - Facepunch has implemented many items that encourage friendly player to player interaction. From shop fronts and vending machines, to mailboxes and notes, and to the new furniture being added to the game, there is certainly a place for your casual gamer. Cons:Don't get this game if you won't treat it like a full time job. You will be disappointed every time you login to find that your base has been raided by a bunch of high schoolers who can spend almost 12 hours a day on the game.Unfortunately, many Rust players are way too serious about their loot. Meaning, they would rather offline raid a base in 30 minutes, than be challenged in an online raid that provides multiple hours of fun for both sides. Also, a lot of \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 talking and bragging about loot in the public chat.Hackers, scripters, and ban evaders are everywhere.FPS Stutters. The game on the highest setting looks beautiful, but expect to take a huge performance hit once you are in a gunfight. I run on potato settings with a high end PC to make sure I don't dip to 10 fps if I get in a big gunfight.Overall, the gameplay in Rust is extremely addicting and you forget what time it is in real life while playing. However, the fact that you have to treat this game like a full-time job and the terrible performance hits is what will kill the game. Still, it remains my favorite.",

It's one of those games I keep going back to after short breaks away from it. I've met some fantastic people in the game and I've also met some not so great people, but it all depends on the type of servers you play on. This game is not suitable for children, so if you're a parent reading this, don't buy it for your child.If a story-rich, quest based game is what you're looking for, Rust isn't the game for you. Try the Fallout series. Rust is a dystopian, multiplayer survival game without a clear story. The story isn't written anywhere but you can kind of gather the history of the island from playing it over time. While Rust is categorized as a PvP game, that isn't always the case. Over the past few years that I've owned and played Rust, I've learned that PvP is only one of the many server types that Rust offers. Sure, the Facepunch Official servers are all PvP but the privately run, community servers offer so much more. I'm a casual player myself so I prefer to play on PvE servers. Servers where the whole raiding and killing other players isn't possible and the true survival part of the game shines through. If PvP and/or PvE servers aren't your thing, there's also roleplay servers and minigame servers. Roleplay servers offer the ability for you to play the role of a fictional character and minigame servers have a ton of games for you to play within Rust. No matter your play style, Rust has some aspect of the game that everyone can enjoy.",

I have been playing Video Games since PAC-MAN hit the game rooms, so when I say this game is unique and different from all the games that I have played before, please don't think that I exaggerate. I got frustrated or raged in games before but I have never had a big adrenalin rush before or had a cocktail of many different feelings in a game before. The first week of Rust burned into my memory, remembering running scared and losing myself in the game, it was too much. It was a Love & Hate, for which I kept coming back. You can become a hero or rich in a second and lose it all in another second and you can become the villain you despised so much. You will meet horrible people and great ones. With Rust, my game expectations changed so much that I can't play single-player games for very long now. I used to be lone gamer, but this game made me buy headphones with a microphone, my friend list went from 0 to 30. I started following YouTubers. I learned new words. I am not that salty anymore against toxic players, PvP became a norm, PvE became fun, going deep became a goal\u2026 It even had effect on my life that possession became more irrelevant - that this game showed me everything is fleeting over and over again. There is love, anger, betrayal, revenge, and all kind of roleplay\u2026 and I have grown in it.",

I told myself I would wait to do this review, that I would let it settle, that it would one day be finished and then I could write my thoughts. Well, too much time has passed for me to wait any longer, and for some reason, today seems to be the day.I'm not even sure now how I discovered this, \"new game with a cool idea\". A friend, DayZ-exploring, a flashing Steam store page, who knows. But once I installed it, and loaded it up, I had found a new, exciting video game. The music when loading was incredible, eerie and atmospheric; and this was 'alpha' music? Once I loaded into the world, an island of apparent great size, I enjoyed the experience from the start. Nature, trees, vast distances, animals, ruins, and...people.For that is what makes Rust tick, people. The first moment, not knowing whether to hide, fight, or try to communicate, is telling, and this is a common thread. And with these first moments, come the first deaths, both expected and not. And so comes the first rule of Rust, don't trust anyone. And with this rule comes the choice you have to make, do you strive to live a solo life? Do you have Steam friends that play and can band together? Or do you try to find some team to take you in? Be ready, you are going to die, a lot.I made a shelter, and built, and harvested, and hunted. I ventured into dangerous places and survived. Or died. In the end, it was a great experience. Then came the version changes, at first it was good, bugs were fixed. Then, they started over from scratch, and things started getting different from what made it good in the first place. It was good, then bad, then good, then bad.The game today is worse than it was, a new thing we are seeing in games when they are made to be a service. A game with a golden age, something we used to only see in MMOs. That is why I can no longer recommend this game. I am going to give it a thumbs up, because of my experiences, and that it was worth the money I paid, but now is a different time. Rust is over for me.Graphics: Apart from certain updates and small periods, Rust has always looked fantastic. As they moved into Beta and the modern Rust era, the game both looks great, and takes a great system to run. It's one of the games that gets my PC as hot as it can get. Beware!Sound:Great music and sounds at first, but inconsistent sound production. Seemed like the staff never settled on consistant sounds/music during the process. To me, this shows a lack of focus, which has been clear from every player since the beta started. This developmental blurriness seems to coincide with when Rust had already made huge sales. Pretty much the team had success, and just went in slow-patch mode. It was less about a work of art, a work that could have defined the team of producers and developers for the rest of their lives, and more about making the project akin to updating the software in automatically flushing toilets.Community:It's a multiplayer game, and the community can be tight-knit if you're in good, but overall it's as toxic as it gets. The sadness with Rust comes from both the community and the developers. Nobody is happy, ever. This has bred conflict between players I've never witnessed before. In short, Rust has the worst community of players I have ever seen, and the clear lack of maturity in most players is almost depressing.Overall: Rust was a pioneer, a flagship in a tattered lot, but what made it great also destroyed it. When new games are made in it's shadow, I hope that someone can capture that essence just once again, and hold it tight until a perfect time to share it with the world.",

This stops when you get chased all the way to the place you are running to, you are getting chased because you were spotted picking up 1 industrial hemp plant. You get away from the group chasing you, and you are able to build a wooden starter base. The next thing you know is that when you went for a quick toilet break, the enemy is \u2018doorcamping\u2019 your base, since they don't like where you build your base. They're doorcamping either with spears, or an eoka. This means you are held captive in your own base, which results into not being able to get any further progress. Eventually you open the door, and you die. Currently the enemy is using handmade shells to destroy your beloved wooden door, which actually has sentimental value to yourself. You try to respawn in your bag, which you crafted with the 30 cloth you gained from a couple hemp plants. But unfortunately, you are unable to respawn since your bag has been destroyed, meaning the enemy is full deep in your beloved 2 x 1, and has full control of it. Subsequently you respawn at the beach getting eaten by a boar, next to the amazing lighthouse which is controlled by a naked zerg with spears. To sum this all up, this game is amazing. Try it. Go for it. May the force be with you.",

                "text": "I want to play CS. I want to go see my friends. I want a normal sleep schedule. But I can't have any of it. My internal clock runs off of my TC upkeep, I have nightmares of hazmats and grenade launchers. I know the vents on large oil like the back of my hand. I've gotten deeped on by BChillz, dropped low grade to Coco so he can entertain me by taking small oil while I sit in my base. Lifestomper ordered a hit on me and Wild Mike donated my group lots of AK's. I can't bow kids like Posty, but my game sense is equal or better than iRisk. I always finish a wipe after using up a box of rockets or getting raided myself, usually while I toss and turn in my bed. I learned the AK spray and then FacePunch changed it. My first wipe with boats was amazing, I kept 14 in a boat base to myself. My first ever wipe I met friends I still talk to 3 years later. HJune has highlighted me, and I have highlighted him as well. You don't play this game to get a sense of accomplishment, you play to make plays. After raiding a compound with your friends and finding a box full of GP and another box of rockets, you realize you can snowball. What you don't realize is that you're hooked. You progress so much that when you wind up back to a rock and torch, you don't see it as a set back, but as a chance to do something different. Add in insane building mechanics and an electricity system, monuments, helicopters, zergs, cheaters, and finding Helk playing on a 5x solo/duo/trio, you realize the community isn't as big as you think it is. This \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 game becomes a way to pass the time, and hot damn. I've loved every hour. Add in the fact that FacePunch is an active dev team, putting out massive quality of life improvements and patches, and new content every few months, the $20 my friend spent to gift me the game seems worth the price. I'd pay $60 rn to buy it if I had to. Find yourself a good duo partner to learn the game with, I've seen so many solo players quit because they can't hang in a populated server. Recognize that 95% of players will do anything to get your loot and play accordingly. See you guys next wipe day!",

                "text": "Alright, so here\u2019s my 2 cents after almost 500 hours in the last few monthsTHE EXPERIENCE-solo is essentially impossible if you\u2019re playing near any populated rad towns. -don\u2019t even bother playing on solo/duo/trio servers, they die after the first few days of wipe-do not even consider playing on face punch servers, play on rustafied-good luck getting on rustafied with their 200+ people waiting queue on wipe day -modded servers are pretty fun, 1.5x-2x is the way to go, anything above that and you\u2019re not really having fun. (Essentially cheating in everything in the very beginning of a campaign. It just ruins the experience)THE SCRAP GRIND -scrap grind isn\u2019t necessarily that bad, but expiramenting on workbenches is awful- there are 3 tiers of workbenches:Level 1 has simple blueprints (cheap revolvers, ghetto shotguns, regular pistol bullets, simple stuff, unreliable explosives) Level 2 has higher tier blueprints (smgs, better pistols, semi auto rifles, better armor)Level 3 is the endgame workbench with the best loot. (AK, explosive ammo, c4, rockets, rocket launchers, metal armor, sniper rifle) In the game there is expiramenting on the workbench, where you can get a blueprint that you don\u2019t already have. This system for as it is is a gamble, and it\u2019s pretty good for the lower level benches. Only 75 scrap for the level 1, and it\u2019s actually pretty good for its price. If you don\u2019t have the revolver (probably one of the most important guns in the beginning of the wipe) you can get the revolver, and then research the bullets that come with it. With the level 2 it is still pretty much worth it to expirament. Getting a semi rifle can really bridge the gap for you from being primal to getting good loot. The level 3 expiramenting is very iffy however. You can get really good items like the AK, bolt action sniper, metal chest plate and mask, etc. Researching on the level 3 is super high risk high reward. You on one hand have the possibility of getting an AK, one of the most powerful weapons in the game, or you can get incendiary 5.56 (rifle ammo that is stupid expensive, and nobody uses it) and you need to nearly get another level 3 workbenches worth of scrap to do it. THE PVP -Where do I start. PvP is awful on this game. -god awful stuttering, even with very good PCs-pvp favors the client side, instead of serverside Let\u2019s say you are watching someone go across an open field and suddenly they stop, great time to tap them right? Wrong. They for 1:Aren\u2019t frozenAre yards ahead of what you seeMost likely already killing you.PROJECTILE_INVALID Is your number one enemy while pvpingBASES - Nothing bad I can really bash this game about on their building side. The roof is just one big problem they need to get rid of completely -decay isn\u2019t a problem unless you\u2019re a 1 man inside a 10 man sized base -high external walls are a good way to scare people off; show that you mean business.RAIDING-three different kinds of raiding -onlining is pretty much only to prove a point. It is inferior to offlining, but it\u2019s the gentleman\u2019s way of doing it. It\u2019s essentially impossible to succeed in, unless only a few are online and you are chocked full of explosives. The defenders can just build a wall and metal all your hard work in less than a second (seriously)-offlining is the safer way to do it, but less noble way. You do this if you want loot. Nobody to defend the base, should be smooth sailing. The only problem are the counter raiders.-raiding for the sake of being an \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. These raiders grief bases. The place metal walls in inconvenient places, they wall off doorways, destroy workbenches. Please don\u2019t do this.DEFENDING YOUR BASE-Rust is actually stressful, like seriously.-you spend hours defending your base to make sure it doesn\u2019t get offlined- you wake up thinking \u201cI really hope I haven\u2019t gotten offlined\u201d-you stay up late to make sure nobodies schemin\u2019-it overall takes a toll on your sleep schedule, and it\u2019s more of a chore to play rust than it is a treat.HOW THE GAME WORKS The game is essentially like life. The harder you work in the begging, the better your life is in the end. If you grind all day every day in the beginning of wipe, you can spend your final days in rust not worrying about scrap, upkeep, etc. You can just raid and pvp. I\u2019m too lazy to finish this review, I\u2019ll do it later. Overall, it\u2019s a pretty good game.",

                "text": "What i'm about to do give my review/experience in my days in RUST. NOTE that I have 1500 hours put into this game on my main account plus a few more on this account so im a long time rust player. Now on to my story and experience.MONTH 1-2There i was in the open field trying to figure out how to craft and make stuff. First shack I built I thought I was safe, no I was just a prey for players. They tore my shack down and told me if I wanted a room. Without clear thinking i said yes and soon after they trapped me in there house and I was made a slave. I joined another server and with a minutes I made myself a pipe-shotgun wooo!!!. As I went to farm i noticed 3 guys loaded with gear and heavy artillery. I thought this was a caveman game with no high tech weaponry, nope i was wrong when they shot that bullet in my face. Though i loved everything this game had going. A week passes and I find a hidden somewhat made base and without thinking again make my room right on top and start farming and making new things. Next day I wake up to find 2 guys building on top of the base I made and we have a short stare until they said they are sorry. They thought the base was abandoned. As I return from my farming routine I find a player stealing my stuff from the bottom part which I was going to use. His name was lunch  I took it to shoot him right away, but he shuts the door and managed to stay safe. We soon talked it out and made an agreement not to shoot each other. I trusted him and that was the start of a new friendship.MONTH 2-3My roomates on top dissapeared out of nowhere and in the end it was me and lunch. We did what any rust player does survive and find new things to make. Then we found a player named tanaka. He was a fellow rust player and could make bolt rifles so we made a deal to offer a trade. after the trade me and lunch were thinking, shoot...kill... I chose not to shoot him. The three of us form an alliance and go out hunting for people and yes its the most fun satisfying thing in RUST and I hate it. Everything was perfect until we encountered them. A hacker out of nowhere aimbotted us and from then on we were careful to go outside with valuable stuff because you never know when they will decide to aimbot you. That didn't stop me and lunch until a hacker found our base one day. Turned out he was a little boy and wanted our codes to our house. We said no and he aimbotted us and destroyed everything we had and took so long farming for. That is when we decided to go to a community server as we said bye to the rust players and tanaka.MONTH 3-4Nothing much to say but we just enjoyed our new rust community hacker free or so we thought. Even though there are admin there is a 50% chance that there is a hacker hiding his hacks or clipping inside houses when admin is gone. It was a fun time as me and lunch made new friends and enemies. Though as time went on less players showed up and thats when my good friend lunch left the game RUST. There i was alone but couldn't leave this damn game as i loved it so much. Yes i went back to the official servers and once started from scratch, or so i thought....MONTH 4-9There i spawned i saw the one person i remembered, the one I didn't shoot, the one me and lunch hunted with. Tanaka{Robin}. He offered me a bed and my own room and we chatted for awhile and thus i told him about lunch . Days went to weeks and weeks went to months and slowly me and robin were building more bases and trusting each other with our items. We decided to spend all our wood on at the hanger and thus in a few weeks the batcave was born. During these times i also gained reputation good and bad. Most loved me and I made more friends who would later help me with my enemies. Those that were my enemies called me nothing but a low hacker hiding my hacks. My other sort of rival to own lands was a clan named RST and a few encounters i had with them i shot without any say. Then came another man who i would get to know more as the days went one. His name was doc baby muncher. I didn't really talk to him that much but enjoyed his say when a plane dropped an airdrop. ZE PLANE ZE PLANE. Me and robin didn't see him that much as he was in the other side of the map but he was an enjoyment. Everything was normal each day in RUST. Nakeds players, friends, hackers and more. FYI Doc refers the nakeds as hobos. Even later I slowly made friends with RST and respected them. REP(incinerator,pie,maddy). Then the horrible day came as me and robin encountered the servers first wipe.Month 9-11My love for Rust didn't make me leave,which i hate. NO, instead i went to another server and Rst was nice enough to lend me a small room. Heck i even saw doc and his ZE PLANE ZE PLANE. Robin was with me but made a different base and in that short time EA3 was back and everybody returned. Though not everybody I once knew were there as some of my friends and allies left Rust. It wasn't long until Yes even Robin left right when the server came back up. You will be missed. Thus it was me and my rock. Though there i was addicted to this damn game playing and playing. The batcave was rebuilt,hackers were doubling and players started to vanish because of hackers. there i went solo for a while then one day Doc visited my base and introduced my to Mr ROtten. We went out to kill hobos and later i gave them a guest room. I enjoyed their company and they are one main reason why i stayed in rust more. From friendly player i was turned into an asshat, No we turned to ZE Asshats. I trusted even more and gave them the codes to my entire batcave and so came the chapter of me and the asshats. Then out of nowhere it came again, dam servers.MONTH 11-PRESENTNew server new fresh start and new players. Me Doc and Rotten made a T tower and do what we do best which is snipe hobos. Its been a year and few months now and i'm slowly players are coming back though i'm not sure ill stay here any longer. I've been raided,c4ed, no clipped, befriended, Shot etc.. I have raided, killed, c4ed, and have done it all. I know every trick that rust has and still could possibly learn more things. RUST is a game that shows how you feel about players and what you are willing to do to survive. Rust has one main story and that is your story. I love this and and hate it at the same time. I will never forget how many friends i have made and friends that have left me. who knows i might have an encounter  with them again. This is my Story and history in RUST. I hope you will give this game a chance as developers are even making a new RUST. Thankyou and remember the name of the game is RUST not TRUST(sometimes).Yar....",

                "text": "Out of all the reviews I wrote, This one is probably the most serious one I wrote. For starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game, You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah, its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.But you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor, The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.As Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. I mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.But what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks, Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10. I wonder if anyone actually read this review, I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do. So if you actually read this let me know by leaving a comment so I can be like someone read this peice of crap review yay!",

I die and move on to the next game. If I get a good killer who finds me immediately, hooks me (bc I can't juke whoops), and then patrol camps (which I'm 100% OK with), then no biggie. Next game please~I think a lot of the community salt from killers comes from dealing with rank one survivors that don't actually play the game properly and just run around and flash the killer in the face. And while that is a legitimate strategy, it takes away from the fun of the game in my opinion.As a killer (a horrible one), I've also been called names by survivors who tell me to 'get gud.' Older players ruin it for newer players or players who don't put in 1000s of hours. Just relax and have fun with the game! So what if you don't pip up - there is always the next game :)That being said, this game is crazy fun. Don't let the saltiness of the community keep you from buying the game. Grab it, have fun with it, and ignore anyone who might give you a hard time ;) And don't fixate too much on the ranking process unless you're absurdly highly competitive for some reason (also fine - just try not to let it push you into spouts of anger!), and even then, recognize that there are jerks who play this game, like any other game, and have fun while you compete!",

But they refused to compensate me, saying they couldn't find anything strange in their logs. Rather, they said that if you keep providing false information, you'll be punished strongly. Then, they closed the agenda obstinately. I really loved this game, but now I feel betrayed. I would never recommend it. There are so many bugs in this game and no compensation for the victim.

Sadly I've come to find that PC players are just as ignored as console when it comes to BHVR. Dead by Daylight is an incredible product that is trapped underneath the thumb of idiots who don't know what to do with it. Every update just adds more bugs than features.At one point, years ago, Cote had described the game as \"no longer theirs, it now belonged to the community\" which at the time I thought was beautiful. Years later, however, after new hires like Ethan, the game has belittled, ignored, and straight up asked veterans to leave.DBD releases ptb's to put up a front that they listen to the community while then releasing multiple patches like The Twins, and Mid Chapter 4.5 that completely ignore the complaints of the community. After how many new things broke today, I finally had enough that I was going to submit individual bug tickets to them for every bug they've been neglecting, only to find out they've updated their website to hide bug tickets at the very bottom and shrunk the box to a 5th of the previous size, while having added tons of pictures and ads for the game, and top centering a small FAQ style technical support for things already fixed. BHVR is a company that actively disrespects their community, herds morons like sheep into defending their actively bad decisions by posting occasional memes, and milks the game and its players by working minimally and at their own whim while we beg and plead for them to just acknowledge they heard what we have to say. I'm ashamed I've spent so many years of my life believing in and supporting a game that left me behind years ago without me noticing.",

                "text": "\"Nothing is meant to be fair, and apparently by design\" - Mathieu Cote (Game director On Dead by Daylight)I will try to explain why I write a negative review despite having a lot of hours and constantly playing this game to this day.It's addicting but not in a good way. It's addiction is based on a constant feeling of irritation, the developers acknowledged it during one of their interviews. You will be annoyed by everything. By one of the most toxic communities, by poor balance decisions, countless bugs. Despite bringing the feeling of satisfaction sometimes, your mental state overall will be worse by the end of most play sessions. You won't play this game because you like it, you will play it because you're addicted to the constant feeling of surpassing the irritation. And the worst part is that you will feel rewarded because of the fact that you outplayed players who are there to mock you and verbally abuse you by the end of a game. It's not healthy no matter how you look at it. Even if you have \"thick skin\", it's simply unenjoyable to waste your time on such people when you think about it.Talking about the other reasons why I can't recommend this game: - It requires you to waste too much time grinding and paying. Licenced characters can only be purchased via real money and if you want to get original ones for free, you need to put 100 hours for each character. And there are so many of them, it may take 1000 hours to gain them all for free. - The developers work on their game when they WANT. The reason for that is the fact that this game does not have any competition. This brings flaws and small patches that do not really feel drastic and entertaining. Moreover, if the upcoming changes are disliked by the community, they will be rolled anyways since what can people do, find another Dead By Daylight? Money were put into creation of the things players didn't like, get it or leave. Oh, wait, you won't. - The game feels dull. We have no new content despite new killers and perks that kind of change gameplay. The issue here is that the perks don't do much, currently the game has a few strong perks that the community takes and the other perks are not being used at all unless a player wants to feel less powerful for some reason. And the killers often feel dull as well. Instead of working on the previous perks and killers the developers prefer to make new perks and killers for the sake of pumping up money.- The developers obviously lean towards the side that brings more money with the help of the cosmetics. It's not a secret that killer issues take much more time to be solved when the survivor ones. It brings unfairness into the game in certain cases.- Moderation on the Steam and the official forums will literally ban you for showing any concern about the game's health. If you complain too much, well, stop spreading negativity. This creates a false sense of positivity when the community is furious at BHVR at the moment.- The support isn't really helpful and deals with certain issues quite poorly.Please, do not support this mess. It looks fun on the outside but it's a mess.----I would like to mention one pretty significant thing about the game's developers.The community asked for colorblind setting for more than 4 years. This request has been dismissed until recently.One of the developers called the whole thing boring. Clearly they aren't interested in wasting resources on something that won't bring them much income. I don't know about you but treating people with poor ability to determine colors like that is speaking volumes about the overall way the developers treat their community.",

                "text": "I absolutely love this game. The design of (most) killers, gameplay, chase interaction and being able to play with friends or by myself.I have invested 4 years of game time into DBD. Currently sitting at just over 4K hours total. I've played through all eras of the game and all the ups/downs bugs/problems the game has had. Pre this latest patch the game was sitting at its best point in terms of playability. It absolutely had a myriad of problems but they weren't game breaking and my love for the game helped me to see past them.However, this latest update is an absolute spit in the face to anyone who has invested any serious amount of time into the game at all. The developers changed multiple things that nobody asked for, received the feedback that nobody liked it and implemented the changes anyway. I have been playing online games for years and BEhaviour are by FAR the worst developers at both time management, choosing what to focus their resources on and ESPECIALLY player feedback. They do not listen.Even besides the changes nobody asked for and how poorly they were implemented this newest update has also not only has more incredibly unfun breakable walls added and a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 UI but a myriad of literal game breaking bugs. Walls with no collision, areas of the map (auto haven bus) where the killer CANNOT pass through but the survivor can- which was completely fine last patch AND on the PTB (test servers).The developers stumbled upon a cash cow and just release skin after skin, DLC after DLC, battlepass after battlepass with no care for the people who helped build their game. They balance the game to the casuals and do not care about their core playerbase as they constantly have new players coming in dropping money on DLC's/cosmetics. I do not want to target anyone specifically but they mention in livestreams that they \"use the wiki\" to know what certain perks do- they do not even know their own game. The lead game designer who I won't name is an absolute moron, his views on the game are INCREDIBLY bad and having someone like that helm the ship is HORRIBLY unhealthy for a good player experience.For 4 years time players have been asking for a colorblind mode in order to be able to play the game as some people were unable to see scratch marks due to their condition. For 4 years we were told \"its not on our priority list\". Only when the community REALLY made a big fuss about it did they release that they were \"happy to announce we are working on colorblind filters\". They do not care about the player, only their image.When the last absymal twins update game out riddled with bugs they were very quick to change Moris- something players have been asking to be changed for years, an incredibly easy fix. The only reason it was changed then was to take the spotlight away from how disgusting and unprofessional their released DLC was. I cannot state enough how little they care about their playerbase.I absolutely love Dead By Daylight. But in its current state and with the way the developers handle their game I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Do not buy this product. This is now the second major update in a row that has come RIDDLED with bugs/problems. Please do not support this game.",

Not gonna say its the community or \"OP\" killers, but a major glitch in the system.The whole reason i decided to write this review is to warn new players of a game ruining glitch, and how to fix it.Today my data, 58 hours of gameplay, was completely reset. While playing, i got a connection error, then a message saying \"The season has ended\". When i went to check out my characters, THEY WERE ALL LEVEL ONE.now, to save yourself from this utterly horrible and game ruining experience (which i know will lead to you leaving a pretty bad review of the game), here's a fix!STEP 1: Go to the location of your steam data, then your Dead by Daylight save. (Which in my case is OS (C:)\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\userdata\\129389900\\381210\\remote\\ProfileSaves)STEP 2: Copy the file located within ProfileSaves to a safe location. (I leave it directly on my desktop)OPTIONAL STEP 3: Make a Shortcut to your ProfileSaves folder and place on desktop for easy access.STEP 4: Update your save (copy save and replace) everytime you close the game. If you dont do this, you could lose hours of progress like i did today. (I lost about 4 hours of progress)Good luck to you noobies, and have fun. Because this game is amazing!",

For starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game, You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah, its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.But you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor, The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.As Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. I mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.But what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks, Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10. I wonder if anyone actually read this review, I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do. So if you actually read this let me know by leaving a comment so I can be like someone read this peice of crap review yay!",

I think I've enough Play hours in this game to finally put down a review.I've played Both Sides (killer/survivor) at high level and from I can tell its a Great game given the fact the game style is asymmetric.This Game is very survivor sided ONLY IF the survivors are plying in a groups and with comms (*note for new players, we call them swf: survivor with friends.)As they can constantly exchange information about the killer's activity and turn the game pretty one sided. But there are some killers in the game that can completely ignore the SWF variable(to a certain degree).The killer roster is pretty versatile but the option is very limited after you reach high elo, as only fewer killers are viable in high ranks.THESE ARE THE ONLY VIABLE KILLERS IN HIGH LEVEL AGAINST GOOD SWFS:SPIRIT, NURSE, PYRAMID HEAD, BLIGHT, HAG, DOCTOR, FREDDY, TWINS(sometimes BUBBA and PIG).Rest of the roster are pretty useless UNLESS you have like 2k+ hours on killers so that can basically end every chase within 15-20 seconds and slug when needed.(*NOTE: even the top killers i mentioned takes a lot of time to learn. ESPECIALLY NURSE,EVEN SPIRIT IS NO JOKE TO LEARN, A lot of game senses and predictions are required to play Spirit Efficiently as well)*I Don't like how every time the DEVs buffs a killer, they also Nerfs the killer in some other way as well.*There are a lots of Perks in the game that are basically useless and a little buff could change them into playable perks.*Hit-boxes are terrible in this game when I play NURSE/HUNTRESS.The community is mostly toxic and unwelcoming towards new players, especially new killers.My first trapper game I got bullied with ds's, Head on & flashlights  unnecessarily, and endless t-bags at the exit gates(having no clue half the game what's going on), and on top of that abusive texts and endless insults in post game chat. This is very discouraging towards new players. If this goes on people will stop playing killer and abuse the very killer when they play survivor next time. this not only creates a bad cycle but also heavily impacts the match making as fewer people are interested in playing the killer.Still there are many nice people in this  community that appreciate the other sides when they play and i hope more people could have that mindset to make the community better.",

                "text": "Dead by Daylight is an amazing assymetrical survival horror game. I will provide a pro/con list, and then rebuttle the most common negative claims against the game. * Developers are active within the community* Lots of progression and levelling to give you a reason to keep coming back* Survivor perks from DLC are accessible to those without DLC, only requiring extra effort.* Game is, despite what some players may say, balanced.* Allows teamplay with minimal communication* Lots of tension, and some required decision making* Long lifetime, game produced 1 year ago, and still supports an average of 8,000-10,000 players per day* Decent amount of the community is toxic, but welcome to the internet* Peer to Peer connection (If the killer's internet is bad, your ping/connection will be bad)* There are a fair amount of bugs/glitches in the game, but none are entirely game breaking. One popular claim is that the game is horrible due to it's toxic community. My main contention here is that the game does not permit voice chat, and instead provides you with two emote options. One to point, and one to wave. Some survivors will tbag on the other side of objects just to aggravate/annoy the killer, but that isn't really a viable issue to hate the game for. Overall the coommunity is no reason to hate the game, and it isn't even that severe. A second, extremely popular complaint, is that camping a surviver that is on the hook as the killer is overpowered and should be removed somehow (which would be incredibly complicated to do from a development standpoint). The issue with this complaint is that the only time when camping is affective is when all of the survivors commit their time playing to attempting to save the survivor on the hook. If instead, the survivors chose to work on generators, statistically they could each get over 1 generator done before the player on the hook died. This would allow the players to complete enough generators to escape with only 1, or if unlucky 2... survivors being sacrificed. The issue is not with the game, it is yet again an issue with the failure of players to adapt.Another claim is that the new killer, The Huntress, is absolutely unbalanced. The reason for a lot of complaint is that The Huntress is the first ranged killer in the game. Is she overpowered though? Not at all. I have played against an incredibly large amount of killers choosing to play The Huntress, especially seeing as it was released just one day before I made this review, and have won the vast majority of the matches. The Huntress was placed into the game to allow for both far more variation in gameplay, and to shake up the \"meta\", forcing players to adapt. The issue with that is, however, a lot of players do not wish to spend time adapting, and instead resort to despising the developers. I appreciate their attempts to add far more variation and effort into the game. One key detail that people who complain about the new killer fail to mention very often, is that the new killer can be heard from much further away, allowing for the survivor to react quicker, and hide appropriately. Although some may say that the sound of the killer's humming is quiet, in a game such as Dead by Daylight, sound is everything. You should be prepared to commit your attention entirely to the game during a match. If you do not, then your failures are not a result of the development team.Many players also complain about the lack of voice communication, because they do not feel as if your current implemented communication methods, pointing and waving, are effective enough. However, as seen with Friday the 13th: The Game, you will absolutely ruin any hopes of immersion and tarnish the horror aesthetic when you enable voice chat, which results in players blasting loud shrek theme songs through their microphones, or yelling the entire game so that you, again, can not pay as much attention too the actual game. A reply to my claim might say that you could simply permit blocking players so that you may not hear them. However, if as you said, the community is toxic, how many players do you honestly think you will not have to block? Even if you don't have too block people in a game, the killer would suffer tremendously from that communication. It is for this reason that a majority of people playing killer in the game recognize that survive with friends (swf) is even nearing overpowered. This is because the implementation of a survivor queueing system allows for survivors to communicate more, and better counter the killer during a game. If there is a great deal of hate towards a smaller system such as swf which even slightly allows voice communication, the development team should surely know better than to implement a full voice communications system for players. And they do, so I commend them for their resilience with putting up with the community's failure to fully think out their complaints.",

Where killing requires significantly more concentration, survivor is somewhat more chill as an experienced player, but is often an M1 simulator if you dont involve yourself with the game much. This repetivity is very clear, but the different survivors you play against all have different playstyles, and the killers have completely different \"powers\" which can tilt the game at any point. If you want a more relaxing experience to sit down and play something, then it would be better to play survivor. Killer requires endless concentration and intense focus so you need to be in a proper gaming mood.I would highly recommend this game to someone who needs a time-waster video game and wants to funnel some hours into it in their spare time. It's a good horror for the first 50 hours but loses that factor after you stop taking the game seriously in terms of getting scared. There is a grinding system involved which will take anyone a long time to get anything especially the bare bone amount you earn ingame, but achieving the grind and getting the perks (massive game  factor) that you want that will greatly change the way you play. It's just amazing and the game I turn on everyday for a good 6+ hours.",

Then either the Survivors or Killer can turn the odds in their favor to make fools out of the other.Pros--Playing as a slasher flick killer. 3 of them with more in the works.-Being a victim of a slasher flick. Escape death with skill, maybe just dumb luck, or die in soiled pants.-4v1 gameplay that goes extra lengths to make each side stand apart from the other.-Great use of sounds for information.-RNG tile based maps. 1-2 landmarks per map will aways be in the same places, but everything else will change every game.-Games last 10 minutes on average.Cons--Some model bugs like rarely seeing your own hair/eyes as a Killer or some janky movement with Killers interacting with suvivors.-Balance. One Killer is weaker than the other 2. Windows close together can make near 100% safe zones for survivors depending on a few things. Some perks are rather annoying, maybe a touch OP.-Games have no timers. If someone wants to waste your time, they can if they are good enough.-No communication. It is impossible to talk to each other without 3rd party chats like Steam, Teamspeak, Skype, ect.-Making a lobby as a Killer can take up to 10 minutes to fill. Not from player counts mind you. Either another bug or a waiting list with strict \"first come, first filled\" rules.In short-For $20 you are going to get one hell of a fun game! Just note that it might not be for everyone as not everyone can handle playing as victims who are by design made to be helpless more often than not.",

There's a current issue where people can get your IP from DBD and use it to DDoS you or even worse SWAT you. Neither of these issues have even been addressed by the devs and there's no telling when they will be fixed.The devs also have very questionable balancing decisions since they focus too hard on creating a perfect average of 2 kills & 2 escapes. As a result, at a certain point your personal skill stops to be the deciding factor and it comes down to many of the rng spawns on the map.",

If your goal is to play killer, then this game is for you, but if you plan to play survivor, you will be frustrated. The developers keep buffing killers with every update while nerfing survivors.

                "text": "This is simultaneously the most fun, and most infuriating game I've played in a long time.It's an asymmetrical game where one player is a powerful killer, hunting down 4 elusive survivors before they can start generators and leave the trial.For an asymmetrical game, it's in a state where it's surprisingly balanced between the two sides. Either side has a few things that infuriate the other and certain killers are notoriously overpowered, or underpowered. Freddy Kreuger mains, for instance, must hate themselves to play that, and Nurse mains must just hate playing the game fairly.New content is regular, 1 killer, 1 survivor, 3 perks for each side, and a map are released every 3 months or so, mid chapter balance patches occur, and cosmetics are regularly added. Recent content additions have, however, cut back on content. A new map hasn't been added with the last 2 additions, each of which only contained 1 character. They have also dropped the term \"paragraph\" which used to refer to 1 character being added and now refer to all DLC as \"chapters,\" meaning their roadmap now suddenly promises a lot less future content. They are also reworking an old tileset to have \"5 different configurations\" changing the layout but using the same buildings, meaning much less variation than original tilesets that have 5 completely unique maps built on them. Recent killer additions have been mediocre at best. The Legion (Dec 2018) was released and completely changed the chase dynamics for the killer, which was blatantly broken and had very little counterplay. They were soon nerfed into a state where they barely feel like they have a power any more. Since then, the Plague (Mar 2019) and the Ghost Face (June 2019) have powers that are overwhelmingly controlled by the survivor players more than the killer, making them incredibly frustrating and unrewarding to play. Due to their mistakes with Legion they seem scared to release killers that actually feel decent in the meta. Only one \"strong\" killer has been added in the last 2 years.There are downsides however. While balance patches come regularly, they won't do anything incremental. Freddy is ridiculously weak, but they refuse to give him small quality of life changes that they have said he needs until they are ready to release a full rework of him. Meaning rather than sitting at a 'meh' stage, he sits in boring, weak and generally unfun. His upcoming rework has finally been announced in (some) detail, which, going off the most recent version we've heard, leaves a lot to be desired.Pay to pay to keep paying. Buying the game will net you around one third of the cast. Many are also available through grinding, however licensed killers and survivors require further payment. Their perks are also locked to you, unless they are picked on the \"random\" weekly shrine. (The good ones rarely are.) On top of this, despite in game currency being used for cosmetics, anything they think looks good or will be popular is locked behind payment only. It's a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 move when you may have already spent upwards of $80 just to unlock characters.Awesome, and incredibly angry, community, as you'd expect from a game like this.Edited to reflect changes since review.",

                "text": "Dead by Daylight is an asymmetrical multiplayer game where one of the 5 players takes the role of the bloodthirsty Killer and the rest of the players do take the role of the survivors trying to fix engines in order to unlock the exit gate. The game was developed and published by Release Date: 14th June 2016Last known update: 1st December 2020Now many people do have questions about balance in asymmetrical games. Games like Friday 13th had the problem of the Killer being too strong while the newly released Resident Evil Resistance is a cakewalk for the survivors. Dead by Daylight on the other hand actually managed to become a truly balanced game. Back in 2016 and 2017, it was clearly a Survivor focused experience but with many updates, they managed to create a very pleasant and truly balanced experience.After almost reaching 400 hours in Dead by Daylight and reaching Rank 1 as a Survivor and reaching red ranks as a Killer I decided to review this game.The main idea is pretty simple, you as the survivor will work and complete 5 engines that are scattered throughout the map. After completing these engines you will have to find one of the 2 exit gates and pull the gate trigger until they open. It sounds simple but you do have to realize that a Killer will give you problems while trying to complete the engines. Now you may ask, what can the survivor do in order to \u201cfight\u201d against the killer? You do have multiple available game tactics while using perks and items. There is a build that does allow you to run a killer for a lot longer, other builds allow you to hide and make the Killer lose time searching for you, and lastly, you got builds that do allow you to help your teammates. Obviously, there are a lot more builds but these are the most common ones. Items have multiple uses honestly, Toolboxes and their Add-ons do assists you at either breaking hooks are working faster on engines. Medkits do allow you to heal up pretty fast and the Flashlight has multiple uses against killers or blinding killers, you can even save a survivor friend from the killer\u2019s grasp! The map obviously offers interactive areas for the Survivors, you do have pallets that you can throw on the killer. If you do happen to succeed in hitting the killer with a pallet you will successfully stun him for a couple of seconds.Now the Killers goal is pretty straight forward. You will have to kill all of the Survivors, simple right? Well not really. As a Killer, you should know when to chase and when not to chase. There are certain areas in each Map that are basically built to make the killer lose time. One good example is the Killer Shack and is basically build for the strengths of the survivor. Usually, you should avoid this building. Just like the survivors, you do get the options to run a variety of builds. One difference is the fact that some Perks do work exclusively with Totems. These totems are usually lit which means that survivors usually tend to break them. Killers cannot use any items other than their unique abilities but they can use offerings and Add-ons just like the Survivors. In order to completely kill a survivor, you will have to hook him 3 times. Lastly, if you have killed 3 of the 4 survivors you can try to find the Hatch which works basically as a secondary exit for the survivors. If you find it first you can simply close it, after that the 2 exit gates will be powered.The survivors are pulled into the Entity's constructed world when they wander too close to the places the killers were taken from, disappearing from the real world without a trace. They end up at a lonely campfire, where they rest between trials until a killer pursues them again. This basically is an endless cycle. Each trial takes place in a series of realms constructed by the Entity of areas from where the killers were taken. The survivors' only hope of escape is to complete a series of generators scattered throughout each realm to power up large gates to escape. If the killer has killed all but one survivor, the Entity will offer the latter a final means of escape in the form of a hatch. Escaping from the grounds always takes the survivors back to the campfire, and offerings can be created to be burnt at it and appeal for the Entity's favor. Since the Entity feeds off the hope of the survivors to escape, it helps them just as much as the killers, acting as an impartial observer of the hunt, stepping in only to claim those hung on its hooks. The Entity is the essence of evil basically.The game makes use of Unreal Engine 4 which gives this game a unique and creepy look. Obviously not the best looking game but it does look decent enough. Sadly the performance is terrible when it comes to some older devices or even Mid-range devices which is crazy when you consider that this game doesn\u2019t even look that amazing.DBD currently is the best asymmetrical multiplayer game available. The depth of the mechanics and skill set is just amazing as well as the community. Sadly bad performance and bugs make this game a hit or miss for some people.",

                "text": "NOTE: This game was gifted to me by someone affiliated with the developers.What's even more fun than chopping people up with your homemade machete while they're stuck in your bear traps? Well.. chasing down your friends with a chainsaw while you're on TeamSpeak with them and screaming \"COME HERE LITTLE PIGGY!\". This game is heavily based on the old slasher movies. There is one killer and four (stupid) teenage survivors. The survivors' goal is to fix all generators, open one of the two exits (or hidden trapdoor if you're last alive) and escape. The killer's goal is *surprise!* killing all of these stupid kids and hanging them on hooks to offer them to his Lord and Savior Satan AKA \"The Entity\". The kids can't defend themselves against the 7 foot tall maniac, but they can use the environment to their advantage. You can hide in lockers (Outlast!), throw piles of wood behind you to block the killer's path or stun him when he's right next to it when you throw it down and you can use the mist in combination with rocks, trees etc. to your advantage to hide behind aswell. The only thing that's missing is a black guy, because they are always supposed to die first in slasher flicks, but oh well.. Future DLC?There is five different items that you can unlock as a survivor and these will help you win. They are: the med kit, toolbox, map, flashlight and Skeleton Key. The med kit lets you heal people faster, while the toolbox makes you fix generators quicker or can let you destroy hooks to ruin the killer's day. The flashlight can be used as a flashbang towards the killer. By shining into his eyes for 1 or 2 seconds he will be temporarily blinded and anyone who he might be carrying on his shoulder will be dropped. And then there's the map. In my opinion the most useless item in the game, because it shows you what generators have been previously used by highlighting them through the walls for a short amount of time. If you have add-ons for it (I'll get to those in a bit) then you could also see the killer's aura, aswell as the exit locations. And then finally there is the mysterious Skeleton Key. Not much is known about this yet. I've played for about 40 hours at the moment of writing but I haven't gotten one of these yet; I have got add-ons for it however. Apparently the Skeleton Key lets you unlock the hidden trapdoor on the map after only 2 generators have been fixed already (while normally it will only open when you're last alive) and then you and all your friends can just jump through it for an insta-win. Don't take my word for that though.Besides items there is a lot more to leveling and progression. All four survivors and all three killers have their own \"progression tree\" which can further developed with Bloodpoint, which are gained from finishing public games. Every survivor and every killer has his/her own unique perks and progression tree. You can keep progressing until you're level 50 and then you can go \"Prestige\" which will reset you back to level 1 and gives you a random bloodied cosmetic item for that character. All your perks and items get taken but you'll keep your 4 perk slots.Besides the Leveling System there is also a Ranking System for public games. You start at rank 20 and you can work yourself up all the way to rank 1. Survivors and killers each have their own online rank, but unlike the levels which are tied to each different character, your rank is only tied to a category: either survivors or killers. If you get enough points you will receive a \"crystal\" or even two if you manage to get the max amount of points. As soon as you collect 3 of these \"crystals\" you will rank up. At some point you'll need more than 3 and this amount keeps increasing the higher you get. If you don't get enough points in a match you will lose a \"crystal\" and when you're back to 0 crystals you'll lose your rank again. Right now there's not really a purpose for these ranks, besides showing others how brave and pro you are. You don't get matched with the same ranks and there's no unlocks or whatsoever, besides a colored number showing above your head. Also, you cannot earn bloodpoints or rank up in private games. All of this requires you to play with random people.We already talked about items, but there's a lot more to your loadout. So, let's talk some more about add-ons, perks and offerings, shall we? There is add-ons, which are additional smaller items which you can attach to your main item to make it better, such as adding more charges to your med kit or being able to use the flashlight for a longer duration of time. Then there's offerings. Offerings can only be used once at the start of the match to get a one-time advantage over the killer. Such as all four survivors starting together or receiving 50% more Bloodpoints for the duration of that game. And finally there's perks. Each character has its own unique perks that help them in the game, linked to their personality and profession. Dwight is the Leader and so if you stay close to him you will repair the generators quicker. Meg is the silent cat girl who is quicker and more silent than the others. Claudette is the botany trained healer, who is better at healing others and Jack is the traps expert who can easily take care of and destroy traps quickly.Now that we've talked about the survivors, let's talk about the killers. There is three different killers, each with their own unique weapon and skill. The Trapper can place down bear traps around the map that you can get stuck in and make you an easy pray for him. The Wraith can go nearly invisible as he pleases and suddenly pop up behind you to scare you like crazy. And the Hillbilly has a chainsaw that he can rev up to go into a crazed murdering state and come chasing after you while he holds his chainsaw above his head. Oh yeah and that also instantly downs you if it hits you.. I wonder what killer is going to be added next. I can't wait to chase people with a big, crazed, evil clown with a sledgehammer. Also real slashers like Jason Voorhees or Michael Meyers might be cool to see, in their respective areas, but I'm not sure if they can get the rights for that.It also seems as if there has been made an area for each different killer. There are 3 different areas, each with 4 different maps. There is the Car Junkyard (linked to the Trapper), the abandoned Coal Factory with a broken bell tower (linked to the Wraith) and the old farm, full of the fantastic cornfields and more (linked to the Hillbilly).All with all it's a really fun game, both to play with strangers, aswell as to play with friends, which I recommend the most. There is currently still some missing features however, like being able to play with your friends in public games, or some kind of chat for public games, but it's a really unique game with a lot of potential! The developers are promising a new update atleast once every week, so can't wait to see what's in store for us. I love unique games and I love horror movies, so this game is just perfect for me. It's both fun to play as a survivor aswell as the killer.Things that can be improved or should be added:- You cannot play in a public game with your friends and there's no bloodpoints to be earned in private games.- There is not a single kind of chat mechanic. No text chat, voice chat or even quick chat. So you can't tell your fellow survivors that they can take you off the hook cause the killer is not camping you.- Talking about that.. hookcamping, really ruins the fun!- Several bugs that break the game such as being stuck on the killer's shoulders until one of you leaves.- More rewards for the ranking system, aswell as balancing it so that you can rank up more easily.- Preventions for leaving the game early and you losing crystals for that.- A larger variety of maps (abandoned carnival, huge manor, a village or snow mountains sound like cool ideas).- Voice acting for the killers.",

                "text": "Sigh... this is the hardest review I've had to write.This game is interesting, compelling, and original. The game mechanic is great. The CORE game mechanic actually changes from movement to stealth in a way I've never experienced, even in metal gear games. Its exhillerating being chased and killed as the survivors and its fun to run around killing as the killer.Unfortunately, the game is riddled with bugs. This current update (2/13/2017) made the game unplayable. And that's not me \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about minor changes in game play mechanics... its literally broken and won't launch. I've held off my review in hopes that the developers would patch the game so i can rave about it up and down. Welp the cows have come to pasture and I feel that after playing 120 hours of the game, posting on steam forums about bugs, participating in test servers, and emailing devs all to have a patch that renders the application completely useless i think I've earned the right to \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about it. Hell, I'm a paying consumer so why not?Yesterday I played this game almost all day and night long. In that day, after hearing about the new patch I logged every game I was able to get into and play as well as every game that crashed due to errors. My logs for yesterday are as Follows:68 attempted games played51 games that did not load, crashed, errored out etc.17 games succesfully laucned with no errors and were playedThat means the application worked correctly only 25% of the time. All I can say is to stay away from this game. Its not working anymore... and even on its best days it only worked 1 out of 4 times.If you happened to purchase this game and enjoyed it as much as I did (when it decides to work), put pressure on those devs. Thier game, as fun as it may be, is a defective product.  IT needs to be fixed or WE need to be reimbursed. You pay thier salary... not Behavior, not StarBreeze... YOU!PS, Devs... I will personally remove this post and give it an incredibly positive and equally lengthy review once the game starts working as it should. It is not my intention to keep people from buying YOUR games... it is only to keep people from buying BROKEN games.PPS, Devs... after fixing this game, how likely would it be to see another crossover monster/survivor combo?  I really wanna see a Ripley / Xenomorph or James Sunderland / Pyrimid Head update (just play Konami for the license you \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, its dirt cheap right now)",

                "text": "For starters, the game really was an incredible experience, lots of fun, friends, and stupid glitches and montages that made the game all the funnier. In honesty, this game was great for at least 500 hours.The game is definitely worth getting for its price-- especially if the game is on sale, the better for you.  + Amazing graphics for higher end computers, aspects such as the flames, entity (hook monster), light distortions, survivor and killer skins, and new map graphic updates are beautiful. + Graphics can easily be fixed to suit lower end computers/console players via a resolution percentage bar and other settings (And changes in percentage are drastic).+ Matches are quick to join (5-8 minutes tops unless there is some crazy new matchmaking system that's broken). :)+ Matches are an educational experience, particularly in training the brain to respond quickly and smartly towards fast-paced situations, where even a player may feel some adrenaline (or panic if that's you).+ Players and killers have access to items/addons, which make for more interesting gameplay, allowing matches to be diverse.+ Generally, a single match tends to be a unique experience (until after ~500-600 hours of gameplay). + A large DBD community exists with some great leaders allowing lesser experienced players to learn some great tips and tricks. (Otzdarva, TrU3Ta1ent, etc).+ You get better the more you play; this is true for pretty much any games, but games like DBD make you experience this full-force. Sometimes this is bad (if other survivors are new or suck), but tends to be great in good matches.+ Tons of killers and survivors to choose from, all for a custom experience.+ Rift pass and tome challenges give goals for players to work for. In fact, I think it would be awesome if DBD made tome achievements named after a tome, like: \"Divergence -- complete Tome VI\".+ A constantly active development team that provides a great amount of new killers and survivors every year.+ A great amount of perks which allow for millions of unique experiences for both players and killers alike. Perks are limited to 4 per player in a match, items to 1 per survivor, and addons to 2 per player.+ A ranking system that at least distinguishes players~ there definitely is a difference between playing against rank 15-20 players and playing against rank 1-5 players, so that you as a player are matched with other players that share some experience/mistakes/victories as you (this is not true for every match although). + An incredibly expansive plethora of customization options for players and killers, which can be earned for free just by playing the game long enough. - Rare crashes or disconnection may occur, which actually can lead to DBD punishing a player with a disconnection penalty. (A penalty where you are locked out of matchmaking for about 10 minutes).- As with a large supportive community, DBD unfortunately does have a large toxic community. Sometimes this is so nasty, that you as a player feel powerless.- Many items, cosmetics, and addons are abused, being able to be used in a way that would be considered \"bullying\" in DBD. For instance, it is not fun to be a rank 8 killer learning to play as a killer main and have go against a team of SWF blendettes all carrying utility flashlights with all battery addons (if you are new, you will learn what this is/means). These groups of teammates will finish 3 gens within 5 minutes of a match starting, have one of their teammates work on the last 2 gens, while the other three teabag, dance, and troll the killer with the flashlights, because they absolutely love to rub their \"superiority complex\" all over a killer.- As aforementioned, troll matches and other experiences lead most players to become survivor mains, or camping/slugging/severely tunneling killers. And I mean these terms should be used rarely-- because a lot of survivors will overdo taunting in the post-game chat with \"tunneling trash\" or \"camping slugger *****\". As a result, expect to quickly get into a match as a killer, but expect to wait longer as a survivor.- A majority of matches will be a below average experience, especially for solo-queue players.- There is a great polarized community between killer mains and survivor mains. To be honest, as a killer main and great survivor, I just wish these communities got along better. Maybe if Behavior would support a conjunction group, it would be great. - Tutorial really isn't that great, although it teaches the basics, it really neglects strategies. In order to become a great player, expect to rely on some articles/watching videos.- One of the biggest community failures in DBD is recognizing match progress. I beg everyone to understand the importance of timing. TrU3Ta1ent does a great job of explaining this-- in my experience that I'm sure others will agree with: if a game starts and two survivors get hooked, or even worse, one survivor gets hooked twice before even 1 generator is completed, the game is practically over (killer victory). If two gens are completed before the killer hooks 4 times, the game is also practically over (survivor victory). In all honesty, generator regression needs a rework, so that new survivors really understand the importance of working on a gen, and so that killers are given an opportunity to win against greatly experienced survivor teams. - Some DLCs are absolutely not worth paying money for: for example, the All-Kill chapter has a trash killer (that hopefully will get reworked), the A Binding of Kin also has a trash killer period, Cursed Legacy has a killer that is too hard to play for most players, the Demogorgon from the Stranger Things DLC is too weak against good teams, Ash vs. Evil Dead is a money grab, and many perks are just \"trash\" for experienced players in most DLCs. The reason why I didn't put the Halloween chapter on this list despite it containing the worse killer, is just because the killer and survivor perks are strong, and in fact, Decisive Strike is probably one of the most used survivor perks in all of DBD. - Perks are categorized as \"meta\" or not. This basically means which perks every survivor should use to \"instantly become a better player\". Decisive Strike, Unbreakable, Object of Obsession, Sprint Burst, Head-On, Desperate Measures, and more are a good example of the only perks \"professional survivors\" will use-- this ostracizes a major aspect of DBD gameplay. In short, most survivors will literally never use 80% of all survivor DBD perks and rely on a small list of \"meta\" perks. As a killer main, I will say that these perks are just proof of incapability. If a survivor has to rely completely on one perk, in order to play a match right, that tells an experienced person something. - The ranking system is fairly broken at the time I wrote this review, matchmaking for survivors just sucks, no need to explain this, as any player who plays DBD will experience why this is.- The DBD development team is mostly survivor mains, which means that future updates/etcetera will mostly likely inadvertently have survivor bias. The game has a lot of flaws, but also a lot of positives. For the price that it is and for the experience it offers, this game is totally worth achievement hunting, having fun with friends, and much more. I do recommend this, as even some of the cons listed here might make you or others a better player in the gaming community as a whole (we need to experience negativity, in order to understand how to fight it and become cooperative gamers).

                "text": "Terraria\u2019s final major update, Journey\u2019s End (1.4), is here. And it\u2019s great! I\u2019ll explain to all of you why I recommend Terraria. You should get this game right now since the final update dropped. I\u2019ll try to update my Steam review some more (posted May 5, 2020; edited May 20, 2020; May 28, 2020; March 6, 2021; and August 7, 2021. Thanks for all the feedback! It's much appreciated).Intro:If I were to explain Terraria to someone quickly, I would put it like this: Terraria is a game that has a whole world to explore. You mine, build, craft, fish, and fight to progress through the game. You can focus on fighting enemies and improving your gear to fight various bosses, and/or you can focus on building your house and buildings and making things look pretty. Terraria has something for everyone. The combination of survival, fighting, exploration, and building aspects is satisfying (and I'm someone who usually plays shooter games). So I believe that you can find something in Terraria for you.Building:When Re-Logic added half blocks and slanted blocks to Terraria in 1.2, the building got so much more interesting and versatile. There are so many different types of blocks in this game with their own unique textures and styles, and with paint there are even more possibilities. Some of the creations made in this game are insanely good.Difficulty:Overall, Terraria on Classic (formerly known as Softcore) and Normal mode is not that hard, but just be aware that no matter what, you\u2019ll probably die a lot as a beginner. If you like a challenge, however, Expert mode is the way to go (plus you get extra advantages, such as exclusive accessories, for having an increased difficulty). Even more difficult is Master mode, giving you even more loot than Expert mode. And if you want the game to be especially difficult, you could choose Mediumcore (drop all items on death), or Hardcore (permadeath) during character creation. There is also Journey mode, which is an adjustable difficulty semi-creative mode that requires a Journey exclusive character (can\u2019t go to Normal, Expert, or Master mode worlds). Personally, I think Classic and Expert mode is the most fun way to play.Music:Terraria\u2019s music is great. All of it fits with the style of the game. Almost every biome has a unique song to fit with the theme, and there are different songs for bosses and events as well. I bought the official soundtrack and I love to listen to it whenever I want some background music.Multiplayer:Multiplayer is incredibly easy to set up. The easiest way to play is to join/host through Steam. You can also enter an IP address, which, before 1.3, used to be the only way to play multiplayer at all, but now it's so much easier with Steam integration.Connection is rarely a problem for me, although I think I\u2019ve found that the host has worse lag than the other players, when there is lag that is.Terraria is very fun to play with friends and even just with strangers. There are teaming options, PVP, and other multiplayer elements built into the game. Bosses are often much easier to beat in multiplayer as well, because usually if one player dies, the other player can continue to fight the boss and stay alive long enough to let the first player respawn.Performance:Terraria runs very well. On my custom PC, which is great for gaming, the game runs perfectly on max settings and has nearly instantaneous loading speeds. On my HP computer, which is not built for gaming, and on my 11-year-old Toshiba laptop, the game runs very nicely on low settings, with only minor loading times.There are several video settings that can be modified to help performance. I would recommend at least turning the background and effects off for lower-end computers.Price:Terraria is very inexpensive. It\u2019s one of the few games I\u2019ve bought at full price and found it completely worth it.Struggles:Terraria has a learning curve. There are many things left up to you to figure out from the start. The Guide NPC is there to give some help. Many things, however, are left up to the player to figure out, much of which is just learned through time and experience. I would recommend looking up tips, tricks, and other information online, such as on the Official Terraria Wiki, or watch videos, like those of ChippyGaming and Edward on YouTube. Personally, I enjoy the learning curve, and the struggle to learn new things is just the right amount to be enjoyable and not annoying.To get to the endgame of Terraria, it does take a while. There is so much content and so many bosses in just vanilla Terraria, that it can be overwhelming, and progression can sometimes feel slow. You may want to rush things like bosses, but you have to prepare well for bosses, or else you\u2019ll probably die. I used to ragequit when I couldn\u2019t beat bosses, and I still get frustrated if I can\u2019t beat a boss. Once you defeat bosses, however, it feels so worth it. And you don\u2019t have to follow an exactly linear path either. Also, you don\u2019t have to play for 30+ hours for a full playthrough just to feel accomplished. From one to a million hours, this game is fun for any length of time.My biggest struggle with this game is the grind for certain items. Some items are extremely hard to get, due to low drop rates or pretty extreme circumstances. There are many, many items with a drop chance lower than 1%. Realistically, you won\u2019t get every item in the game, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re aiming for. I once wanted to get every enemy banner in the game (you have to kill 50 of the same enemy to get a banner) legitimately, but I gave up on that idea because of how grindy it is to kill 50 of each enemy for the rarest ones (that darn Nymph Banner). To put it simply, it\u2019s possible to get every item in the game, but it\u2019s just not worth it. You should, however, build farms for certain items. But the point is, just get the items in the game that you really want to get legitimately, and it\u2019ll be worth it (if you did want every single item in the game, you can use inventory editors or go to free item servers, but it\u2019s not fun to abuse these).Tips:* Organize and name chests ASAP* Place rope down a Hellevator* Use Cursed/Ichor Torches (craftable in Hardmode) for Hellevators and bridges, since they\u2019re liquidproof* Use the Hardy Saddle (Turtle Mount) with Brick Layer/Architect Gizmo Pack to place down blocks in a straight line at a constant speed, which is perfect for building bridges. Smart cursor is extremely useful for this as well, which is activated using Ctrl (default)* Look up how to maintain world purity, since the Corruption, Crimson, and the Hallow biomes spread across the world, and the Corruption/Crimson can destroy the Jungle biome over time and do other unfortunate things* Go fishing. It\u2019s worth it. Fishing gives you so many tools, accessories, and other loot that enhance the game tremendously. Once you find the Angler NPC in the Ocean biome at either end of the world, use him to get quests to find a specific fish, which you can redeem for loot* Use Logic Sensors (Player Above) and Actuators for enemy/NPC-proof doors. Be careful about using actuators on blocks though, since it can occasionally reset the room status as suitable or reset your spawnpoint. As of 1.4, doors are much easier to deal with since they can auto open and close* For making potions, use an Alchemy Table from the Dungeon to have a 33% chance to not consume potion ingredients* Use Invisibility Potions while farming for Truffle Worms* Use Warmth Potions for the Frost MoonConclusion:I've played this game for 10 years now. I made a Steam account for this game, and I've played through so much of the game's development back when there wasn't even a fraction of the number of items in the game. To put it simply, Terraria is my favorite game. So after over a 1000 hours of playtime, I can safely say that I 100% recommend buying and playing Terraria.",

                "text": "I've never actually taken the time to write out a real review of a game, but this one absolutely deserves it.Terraria was my first ever game on PC and was the entire reason for me getting one. I had originally started playing the game on my Xbox 360, only to later beg my parents to buy me a computer so that I could play the 1.2 update. After that, I spent hours grinding through the game. It was shortly after my first time completing the game during 1.2 that I played the game again with friends. Though not a memorable experience in of itself, it did pave the way for those friendships to evolve further. Then we get to the release of the 1.3 update in the summer of 2015. I absolutely lost my sh*t for this update. For months my friends and I planned to play through the game again and spend time exploring all the new content. That was my first character that ever surpassed 100 hours of playtime. After that initial playthrough with my friends, I would periodically revisit the game on my own and with my friends for years. Sometimes there would be mods, sometimes it would be the original experience. Regardless of how I played, I never ever got bored with the game. I may only have 1600 hours across 6 years, but each one of those hours was spent in the game having a blast and completing my saves for each character I played on. With the Journeys end update coming out earlier this year, an update I have played through and through, I have finally managed to scrounge up the courage to say goodbye to this game. That doesn't mean that I'm going to stop playing it, that will never be a feasible option to me, especially with a game that has shaped my childhood. This review serves as a ode to an amazing game that has changed my life, as well as a way for me to cope with the game no longer receiving updates.I will forever thank the wonderful company of Re-Logic for an amazing product and the community that has surrounded the game for sharing such a novel game with me. Goodbye Re-Logic, and I look forward to future endeavors. Sincerely,Katie Dixon AKA KittoMen",

Primarily, Terraria is a sandbox game. You appear in a new world with some basic equipment and no real instruction, eventually you will build a small house to survive the monsters that surface during the night, discover some form of corruption eating away at the world, encounter new NPCs and face off against powerful Boss enemies. Despite all this, you are given little direction, these are merely facets of a larger game that allows players to do as they wish, encountering all the world has to offer at mostly their own pace. Part of the great design behind the title is in the difficulty curve I mentioned earlier, meaning challenges pitted against a player start easy and steadily increase at a rate easy to handle. Although traditional RPG elements are largely absent, a discrete levelling system is present in the form of Bosses that have been defeated, meaning if you don't progress through these enemies then the gameplay doesn't become more difficult. In fact, the first boss doesn't spawn until you're suitably equipped with armour and health. My hours in the game are split roughly equally between single and multiplayer. Single player stands up on its own perfectly fine, but in my opinion the game is much more rewarding gathering some friends and working together to tackle the bosses, as the feeling of reaching new goals is shared, and the ammount of 'grinding' for materials is spread across multiple people. It also helps to appreciate the brilliant soundtrack, as if you voice chat with your group then spontaneous humming along loudly is to be expected. Enemy design is exciting and unique, with floating eyes, possessed suits of armour, giant robotic worms, and a ninja suspended in a giant ball of slime all making appearances. That being said, whoever on the design team is responsible for 'hellbats' has earned a special sort of hatred from myself...All in all Terraria is an amazing experience from beginning to end, its tone is humourous at times whist still provoking a feeling of wonderment and mystery in its exploration, and fearful excitement at its combat. It's a game I will come back to time and time again looking to recapture the memories I've made, and to forge new ones. It is a rare game in that with no shred of a doubt, these hours I have spent were not wasted. I heartily recommend that you purchase this game.",

When you're ingame (and I don't really know how to explain it) there's just something very chilling about it, maybe it's the music, maybe it's just every little detail about it.

                "text": "So, here's a simplified list of what you'll find in Terraria: - This is a 2D RPG with platformer and sandbox elements- It has an incredible amount of content to it- Multiple classes that are shaped through armor bonuses (but you can use other items not of your class)- Idk like a billion items? Lots of weapons, armor, cosmetics, and building material. It's crazy- A good healthy serving of cool and interesting bosses to fight- Lots of NPC's to buy stuff from (be ready to build basically a hotel for the like 30 of them in the game now)- Really good retro soundtrack but more modern, that fit the creative environments they pair with. Boss fight music gets you pumped! - Is it too easy for you? Try Expert mode! Don't feel like you're penalized enough for dying? Set your character to Hardcore!- I almost forgot to mention\u2026 SO MUCH CRAFTINGCons? Hmm.- Inventory management\u2026 the abundance of items will overwhelm you. I usually make a structure dedicated to storing all my loot in chests. Stay organized!- Fishing is pretty useful but\u2026 well it\u2019s not exactly exciting. You can get some great stuff that way though.- Expect a big difficulty spike after defeating the boss in the Underworld! You\u2019ll feel like a noob all over again, but once you work past it is where the game feels like it truly begins for me.- Some items in the game are pretty rare and some of these rares are used to craft or otherwise obtain some of the best loot in the game. Other thought: - If you can play with friends, or find people to run through the game with, do it. It's much more fun that way. You can still enjoy it quite a bit single player, however... it's not the same when you can't laugh when someone gets destroyed by a boulder trap.Story time (if you want to torture yourself and read my rambling):I bought this game ages ago, back when it was still in development, before any of the expansions and cleanups it's gone through. I spent $10 on this.Since then, the Dev team (at least back in 2014-2015 or so when I kept up with it) would post threads about once a month at the least to let people know what was planned/ the progress of the game. It kept getting updated, adding more content and mechanics. I remember being super excited when new weapon types were added, rare mounts were added. Accessories so your character can fly around the map? Gimme. Something I always admire too is Re-Logic did not simply focus on adding more stuff end game, they kept polishing up early game too, adding things like Ropes to make things easier until you get hookshots, simple versions of weapons you find later like Spears, wooden yo-yo, more early game magic items. It used to be a much less enjoyable, slower grind to get to mid game content where the pace picks up.There were at least a couple times where the development with the game was supposedly going to halt, and I was satisfied with it then. I'd gotten more content and enjoyment out of Terraria than most games I'd bought for $30 or more. Yet somehow, maybe a year after hearing nothing, a new content update would surprisingly be pushed out. This happened at least twice, when I thought it would be laid to rest as is. I spent $10 on this.",

                "text": "How have I not written a review for this amazing game?I've been playing Terraria ever since the days of early 1.1.1, in the Christmas season of 2011. Over these years, I've logged just about 2000 hours total, along with another 1000 hours played offline. Enough showing off though. Why in the world should you buy this game?Terraria is an experience where you're given basically unlimited liberty. Even before you start, you get to completely customize your character and world. After setting it all up, you get dropped into the center of the overworld, where you can go off to do whatever you want. For those of you who got bored with Minecraft as I did, don't worry, as Terraria completely fixes that problem with branching pathways in weapon classes and self-imposed challenges. You can even get a vastly different experience, cooperating with friends on an extremely easy to-set-up multiplayer server. By hosting directly through Steam, you just open up your world from the Multiplayer menu, and send an invite to your friend(s)! It's that easy! No need for messy port-forwarding or separate third party accounts!If your class specific challenges and multiplayer options can't fill your needs, there are tons of really great mods to check out! Thorium and Calamity are 2 of the biggest ones out there. Thorium blends and balances perfectly with the base game's progression, while Calamity adds some incredibly difficult boss battles and other challenges in higher levels than the progression of the base game (or so I've heard... I'm still blind to most of it). Separately, those 2 add so much on their own, but there are so many others that can change so many things about the game. Possibilities are endless when it comes to modding in Terraria.Back to the base game, the music is absolutely outstanding, and along with the ambient noises, the game has an amazing sense of atmosphere. Evil places feel like they're filled with dark energy and horrible power. Underground caverns are filled with anxiety of incoming danger and hope to find loot. The list goes on...Bosses can be difficult to fight (especially in Expert, and soon, in Master Mode), but the weapons and abilities that you can obtain in Terraria simply make you feel amazing, each one having its own uses. The controls are entirely customizable, even allowing for extra mouse buttons to be used (if you have any), and they're extremely tight. I can't say I've ever seen a more fun grappling hook mechanic than the one in Terraria. It's like a 360 degree hookshot, and the physics feel absolutely perfect on it. There's no better feeling than grappling onto a block and releasing the hook (jumping) early to launch yourself with some huge momentum (then, if you're like me, doing it again immediately in the opposite direction, and repeating). Mobility might be really slow, and to be honest, a bit boring at the start of the game (in Normal Mode, at least), but it greatly improves as you make progress.Lastly, the Terraria community is one of the best out there. So many helpful folks are in the official Discord Server, if you ever have any questions that the Guide NPC or the thoroughly in-depth wiki site can't answer. There are many things I didn't cover here, but I don't have time to go into every reason why I love this game, and I doubt you have much more time to keep reading them anyways. ;PSorry, my train of thought can sometimes go off the rails. Thanks for your time reading this far, and I hope this review was helpful! Hope to see you around in the community! :DTLDR;This is an utterly fantastic game. Do yourself a favor, and buy it.",

                "text": "This is most likely the only review I will ever do for a game, and I believe that the grounds of my review are legitimate. I have played this game for just under 600 hours (Online) and countless more offline, as well as playing it on my friends account for many more hours. 6 years ago, I asked my cousin if I could buy a game. Little did I know what I was getting myself into. It was dirt cheap, 10 US dollars at the time, which is a crime considering how much love and passion has gone into this game, as well as the many sleepless nights it has provided me and many other fans. Waiting for it to download, I was ecstatic. The art style was cool and retro, and the gameplay trailers promised a land filled with enemies and abandoned temples that had succumbed to time, ripe for the picking. Many biomes to traverse and even some hidden gems scattered across the world. I couldn\u2019t wait to get my grubby little hands on it. From the moment I booted up the game, the music and visuals instantly invigorated me. It felt so cool to create your own character, so many different styles and colours, so many choices and personalization\u2019s you could do. I spent around 5 minutes creating my first character, and after that, I was set out into a mysterious world, filled with giant worms and flying spit bugs that would decapitate me at a moments notice. My first night is one I will never forget. Armed with shuriken\u2019s from a nearby cave and stranded on a hill, I had no choice but to fight off the hordes of undead. They were coming at me from every direction, and with demon eyes flying overhead, death was inevitable.As soon as I respawned, my gut instinct was to protect the guide because he had no home to hunker down in. Eventually, we held off the masses and dawn finally came. I had realized that I needed a house to stay in, and that\u2019s when I had discovered one of the best aspects of not only this game, but one of the best aspects of any games I have played; the building. There are so sososososososo many blocks to build, hammer and axe together in intuitive, creative and interesting ways. The early days were not the best for building, as the textures were quite pixelated and low quality. But the quality of the builds had gotten exponentially better. The community came up with so many unique and downright amazing builds, and it only got better with each update. There was sloping blocks, paint, different walls, how each block melded together, how each block interacted with other blocks, the light sources, the different platforms that you could use. All this and more meant that anything that you could think of you could build. This game was one of the best imaginative and creative masterpieces that has ever graced the steam platform. After I was done building my house, I set out to find more loot to plunder. That\u2019s when I realised that this games combat is executed flawlessly. Normal mode was a bit too easy for me, so the combat was less punishing then I\u2019d like it to be, but the devs heard about this and introduced both expert and master mode in later updates providing a perfect balance between satisfying combat and the risk taking nature of the skirmishes that took place within the different biomes. Everything about the combat is satisfying, even hitting a slime with a simple copper short sword or an axe is satisfying. And it only got better from there. The progression is done immaculately, precariously positioning the player on a tight rope of equipment and weapons while also drunkenly swinging at the player from every which way, you have to be on your toes at all time. Just when you think you\u2019ve become a god at the game with wearing molten lava and swinging a sword made of fire, the game punches you in the gut and curb stomps you. And you cannot wait to get back into it.The gameplay loop is a satisfying composition of combat, farming and building. Everything that you do in this game contributes towards progress. Building houses? More NPC\u2019s to trade with. Want herbs? You got potions to buff you with. Fishing? Boom, rare items that could (RIP Reaver shark) catapult your progress into the future, skipping entire phases of the game. Speaking of phases of the game, it has some of the best and most satisfying transitions in between gameplay elements. Every bit of progress that you make feels infinitely more satisfying than the last, and it keeps pushing you forward, to the point of not stopping. I remember trying to farm for a rare item (Turtle Shells) for 14 hours straight, and I only got 1. I did other stuff in between, sure, but the game keeps you hooked in between objectives and allows for some breathing room in between bosses. As well as being incredibly challenging and rewarding, it is peaceful at times.With the Journeys end update, the new music added a whole new layer immersion. I could spend hours flying a kite on a rooftop, listening to the songs and watching my NPC\u2019s just walk around and chat. There is so much to do in this game, its not just combat oriented. And all of this is just in single player! The game has so much support for its community, from steam support and mods all the way up to the wiki and forums that the devs occasionally scour. It is a fantastic game, and I could not recommend it more.I absolutely adore this game, and it has been a vent for my creativity and inspiration over the years. My words could never do it justice, even though I hope to describe even a fraction of what this game has been to me. Thanks for reading \ud83d\ude0a",

                "text": "[TL;DR]* Terraria is a highly replayable sandbox RPG and it is fun whether played alone or with friends. Gameplay:+ Progress through the game by defeating bosses.+ Defeating bosses unlocks new content.+ High player agency, play and progress however you want, at whatever pace you like.Content:+ Contains over 4000 ITEMS in the game to find and play around with, varying from cosmetics to functional equipment and fun silly toys ensuring that every playthrough feel unique.+ Not repetitive, it's fun  and fresh even after completing it several times.+ Offers both a casual experience for casual players and a challenging one for hardcore players.+ Only 200mb for hundreds of hours worth of content. (Even more if you like to min max stuff)[AND NOW, AN ESSAY FOR YOU WEIRDOS THAT LIKE TO READ] (like m-me)* (note: heavily based on my experience, your experience may differ according to your own personal preferences)[Overview]* I'm fairly casual in comparison to other more hardcore players. I stop playing for a few months after a session or two, but every time I touch this game again (usually on a whim) I just fall in love with it all over again despite having completely finished it several times already. Something about this game just feels really satisfying to play and every time i touch it, I was met with an incredibly pleasant experience (even though i die and fail a lot).* Although, for complete beginners, the game is really easy to drop when you first touch it (I know since I dropped it when i first got the game) since you're not entirely sure what to expect, but take your time to learn the basics and do some wiki lurking here and there when you're stuck and you'd find that the game goes much deeper and offers an incredibly rich experience than you'd first expected (I know it did for me).[The Game]* Game flow fundamentally revolves around defeating bosses. You make preparations for boss battles which when defeated, unlocks more options for you to play around with to prepare for the next boss you set your sight on, progressively making you stronger but also changing the world around you, introducing something new with each boss defeated whether that be new equipment, or entirely new areas of the world. * Often times defeating a boss once won't give you everything you want, so you will occasionally find yourself killing a boss twice or thrice. Although, if you prefer, you can do them only once and move on which would be as equally viable as slapping them over and over until you have everything they can possibly drop for you (although it might be bad for the bosses' own mental health).[The Experience]* Terraria doesn't particularly demand you to play it in any specific way. You can play it in any way you prefer and at the pacing you wish to play in. It gives you a goal and challenges you but doesn't confine you to just a single exit, instead it gives you hundreds of tools to play and tinker around with in how you approach the obstacles the game presented to you.* The amount of diversity in the way you can progress and complete this game in is outstanding. My experience in the game didn't feel predictable nor repetitive despite the game having clear checkpoints (the bosses) and a limited world (literally just an island). Despite always having the same biomes guaranteed to spawn in a world, each experience feel new and being acquainted with them does not make the experience bland but instead enriching it since the way you interact with your environment matters, making me feel rewarded the more I know and understand.* It also helps that all content in the game whether it be building, mining, farming, exploring or just good old murder of local wildlife weaves back into the core game progression seamlessly without ever feeling out of place, making it easy to get immersed with the game. Thanks to this it does not confine you to any kind of play style, you may progress through the game however you want to, but it also does not discourage or punish you for straying off from the core progression.[Conclusion]* Its a good game, give it a chance and take your time getting used to it. Don't shy away from the wiki if you feel like you're really stuck or unsure what to do next. If you're not feeling like a hardcore masochist the game also offers a much more relaxed experience through Journey mode characters so try that if you're a really casual player. Fine tune the experience to the experience you're looking for and you'll find yourself in an incredibly pleasant experience (that also involves a lot of dying, but you'll get used to it)So basically,What i want to say is, this game is fun and i love itI recommend it if you're boredI spent 2 hours writing thisIts 3 AMHow'd this happen",

                "text": "I have played this game for 1,055 hours at the time of writing.This is an amazing game. It's ability to make people gravitate back to it after an update is very nice. Speaking of updates, the developers release amazing and wholesome updates from time to time. I really recommend this game for mainly two reasons, it has a great replay ability were you just keep making worlds and playing it over and over again. The other reason is that you can do a lot of stuff with the world. From making giant houses and contraptions to attempting to kill a boss multiple times, it is a fun game. But it is also multiplayer which is a great addition. Playing by yourself can get boring sometimes but when I play this game with my friends, I just can't stop playing. I really recommend this game, it is definitely worth the 10 dollars.EDIT: 1000 hours later re-review (2,123 hours at the time of edit)This game STILL stands as one of the best games I've played to date. Journey's End (update 1.4) was a great update, although it didn't change much in the way of over-all game progression, it revamped and/or added to many of the lackluster parts of the game, (ex: bloodmoon fishing, town rework, new mushroom biomes, summoning rework, etc). There was also variety of balancing changes that were introduced with 1.4, which I believe were for the better. Some staple items were nerfed, but still very good. On the other hand, a lot of niche/\"bad\" items were reworked or buffed, making them on par (or better) compared to many other items. It would also be a crime to not mention the modding scene for this game. If you buy this game, do yourself a favor and download tModLoader off of steam, because oh my, there are a lot of great mods out there. Keep in mind that tModLoader isn't 1.4 (yet), but is still a massive blast and a great experience.Some mods I would heavily recommend are:Calamity (100% this)ThoriumFargo's modsTerraria OverhaulSplitPolaritiesand do not forget to get a variety of QoL mods to help you out (1.4 doors, boss checklist, etc.)",

                "text": "Terraria is one of the top rated games on steam. And honestly, it deserves it. I think this is a damn good game. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s a perfect game and there are certainly some things you should know before you buy it, but I will happily give it a recommend. You start out with a basic sword, axe, and pickaxe, in the middle of nowhere. You\u2019re first step is to get wood and build a shelter to protect you from the zombies at night. Next you need to dig down and get ore to make better gear. So it\u2019s 2d minecraft? Well it\u2019s more than that, let me continue. You\u2019ll need decent armor and weapons to fight the tougher monsters that live underground and to fight bosses. Yep bosses. Bosses are one of the defining elements of this game. Bosses are big and imposing and they play this awesome adrenaline music when you summon them (a lot of the Terraria music is awesome btw). And there\u2019s a huge variety of bosses too: There\u2019s a floating eye that aggressively charges at you, there\u2019s a big worm creature that breaks into smaller worms as you damage it, there\u2019s an angry plant that can only be fought in the claustrophobic jungle, there\u2019s a cult leader that summons mirages of itself and makes the game into a bullet hell with how many projectiles it spits out. Now bosses can be very punishing, but this is a building/crafting game, so you can build your own arena with platforms to jump on and walls to protect you from (some) attacks, or craft potions that boost your speed, health regen, armor, and damage. The fact that you can tackle bosses on your own terms in your own arena is one of the most interesting parts of the game and it really makes boss fights feel epic. Killing bosses is the main way you progress through the game. Killing them gives you some kickass loot or lets you access a parts of the world where you can discover some more kickass loot. There\u2019s a lot of loot in this game. And it\u2019s some pretty cool loot too. You get staffs that call meteors down from the sky, fireball staffs, swords that shoot fireballs, machine guns, rocket launchers, different kinds of ammo to go in your guns, yo-yo\u2019s (yo-yos are a really cool weapon), boomerangs, tools that summon monsters or turrets to fight for you, tools that let you jump real high (useful for dodging boss attacks), vehicles that let you move real fast, grappling hooks for going spelunking. The more bosses you kill and the further you progress, the more powerful and interesting the loot you get. Seriously, getting new loot just feels absolutely wonderful in this game.So yeah, I would say mining, boss fighting, and collecting loot are the meat of the game, but there\u2019s plenty of gravy too. Maybe you want to take a break from boss fighting and do some fishing so you can get a chainsaw fish and also some potion ingredients. Well then you probably want to create a few ponds throughout your world. And you\u2019ll probably want to set up some minecart tracks or teleporters to get to your ponds quickly. Or maybe you want to set up a mushroom farm because mushroom are good for potions as well as crafting some late game armor. Well you\u2019ll want to create several rows of dirt so the mushrooms have plenty of surface area to spawn on. And if you don\u2019t want to harvest mushrooms manually you can set up a bunch of conveyor belts and wire so the mushrooms just fall down and come to you. Or maybe a part of your world is corrupt. Corruption spreads slowly so you may want to dig a trench around it to keep it quarantined, or you can buy a special gun that cleanses corruption outright. Or maybe you need a bunch of unicorn horns. You could go to the part of the world where unicorns spawn and kill them with your flaming yo-yo. Or you could dig a big pit and every time a unicorn come by it falls into the pit and dies because the pit is full of lava and spiky traps. This is a crafting game where enemies are just another crafting resource, so setting up a death pit to farm unicorns is a logical thing to do. There\u2019s plenty of stuff to do in Terraria and plenty of ways to do it. First of all, the difficulty. Specifically, the bosses. Bosses will kill you. Bosses are tough. You can give yourself boosts with potions and armor, but dodging attacks is your best bet. And that can be very difficult when the boss charges rapidly at you or shoots a dozen balls of lightning at you. You will need to learn the attack patterns of bosses and you will need to train your reflexes. I mentioned bullet hell earlier, and I really do think this game has bullet hell elements. If you just can\u2019t stand bullet hell games you probably want to avoid Terraria. (Since difficulty is a pretty subjective thing, you may want to look up a video review of Terraria and see some boss fights and combat for yourself.)Another thing I want to mention is the sheer amount of stuff to learn. You should be prepared to spend a lot of time on the Terraria wiki. It\u2019s a crafting game, so you\u2019ll need to look up crafting recipes as well as how to get ingredients. It\u2019s also a game about fighting giant bosses, so you\u2019ll need to know how to summon bosses and you\u2019ll probably want to read some tips on making an arena. If you want to build a garden or fishing pond you\u2019ll want to know when certain herbs bloom and how much water to put in your pond. For building more complex structures, you may want to look up tutorials on youtube (the game has gone through several updates though, so some youtube tutorials are out of date). Personally, I kinda enjoyed learning the game. I\u2019d get some weird item in my inventory and immediately going to the wiki to see what I could do with it. But I realize not everyone wants to study a wiki while they play video games. One of the interesting parts of the game is how it\u2019s a building/fighting hybrid kind of game. And while that\u2019s cool some of the time, it can be really annoying at other times. Say you\u2019re underground building an arena to fight a boss, then a bat flies out at you, now you have to stop building and take out your weapon. So you kill the bat and try to get back to building, but another bat spawns and you have to kill that one too. The game literally has a formula where if it detects there aren\u2019t any enemies near you it will spawn new enemies, so you will constantly have to fight off annoying enemies while you\u2019re trying to build or mine. (I should mention that there are tools that help deal with enemy harassment, but you need to know how to get them, which reinforces my point that you need to read the wiki) I don\u2019t really like Terraria\u2019s endgame. Most of the early and midgame consists of exploring, building, and crafting, with the occasional action-packed boss fight thrown in, which I like because it offers some nice variety. However the endgame is back-to-back combat. Fight a boss, then fight a bunch of minibosses, then fight another boss, then fight four living towers which spawn very fast very dangerous enemies, then fight another boss. For my first playthrough of this game I stopped playing when I got to the endgame because I just didn\u2019t want to slog through all the fighting. Now, I actually like the combat and I liked fighting bosses throughout the game, but it\u2019s a simple combat system and fighting loses some of its charm when you do it for too long. So this review turned out longer than I expected. I guess I wanted to be thorough. When I first played this game I got pretty frustrated at times and I was prepared to toss out the game altogether. But then I got into it a bit more and learned the mechanics better and I actually really liked it. Despite its flaws, this is probably one of my favorite games ever.",

                "text": "Most likely, my review will remain in the shadows, and hardly anyone will reach the end of my review, I still want to share with you my feelings and the seasoned spirit of adventure. It all started many years ago, when I got acquainted with one of the most wonderful, warm, and memorable games in my life - Terraria. When pronouncing this word, I immediately feel warm in my soul, I remember the wonderful soundtrack and completely immerse myself in my thoughts. Before reviewing, I immediately want to note that this game gave me a new perception of computer games, and gave me a great childhood.I myself am not an ordinary player in Terraria, and there are few such oldies, because I got acquainted with Terraria even before its release, or more precisely, before the official release of the game on Steam (May 16, 2011). And although I have played 200 hours of this game in my Steam, I actually played it for about 1000 hours. When I was little, I, like all children, played Minecraft, and I really liked this game, I thought that I could not find a better game. But one fine day, my dad came home from work and told me about Terraria, which just appeared. Another employee told Dad about the game, and another employee told this employee, and then I don't know the story of the spread of rumors about a brand new freshly baked Terraria. When I first started the game, I created my character, spending several hours on it, pressed the button to create a world, and found myself on the ground. Someone walked next to me, his name was Guide, who first fell into the abyss ... I don't know why he did it, but it didn't really bother me. The first thing I learned was how to walk, jump and dig, and it was incredibly fun! After that I dug a hole for myself, buried myself on top and went to play Minecraft ... Don't judge strictly, but for a child then Minecraft was much more colorful, and had a 3D view, and not a cropped 3D space along the Z axis. But a couple of days later I went back in into the game, and again continued to explore the world, the game did not cause as much enthusiasm for me as many people who have started playing quite recently. And I don't know if it's good that I started playing such a raw game. But as time went on, I studied the world of Terraria more and more. I got to know cute teardrop-mongers and creatures that were constantly killing me. I realized that I needed a home to live, and that's when I discovered one of the best aspects of not only this game, but one of the best aspects of all the games I've played - building. So I gave up traveling and started BUILDING and DIGGING! And then this game completely sucked me in. I quit Minecraft and started DIGGING, KILLING, AND EXPLORING. I met new residents who can SELL! And a nurse who can CHOOSE! I also realized that the Guide is not a useless piece of garbage, and that you can have a heart-to-heart talk with him. In the end, I killed the ominous Eye of Cthulhu, which sowed fear, and the game ended there ... But soon new updates came out, I downloaded new versions and went all over again. And it was interesting. I went through each update, and did not get a mental pleasure. Since I like everything more difficult, I started playing the game on the Expert Advisor, and later on the Master. But all this was not enough for me! And I started to go through mods, for those who know Calamity mod, I went through this game with Revenge and Death modes, and also after a few hundred attempts I went through Boss Rush. Then I lost my nerves.With each update, the game brought new emotions and a colorful world to the players and me. Every progress you make is much more satisfying than the last one and continues to push you forward, to the point where you don't stop. There is no point in talking about old versions, so I'll tell you a couple (hundreds) of words about the new Terraria.For me this game became a home in which I felt comfortable. The game is currently in the game about 500 varieties of mobs. There are also 19 bosses and 13 mini-bosses, as well as 3 additional bosses in the mobile version. And from listing recipes you can break your tongue. Sloped blocks, paints, different walls were added to the game, each block merged together, each block interacted with other blocks. Light sources, different platforms that you may have used. All of this and more meant that anything imaginable could be built. Many people create amazing mechanisms and worlds, better than on paper!) Although they made a convenient interface for creating my character in the game, I also devote a lot of time to creating a character). And the music and style of play makes me crazy. I bought this game for my every account, and made all my friends, no matter if it was voluntary, to purchase this masterpiece. And if you are thinking whether to buy this game, I can hardly answer you ... YES !!! This game is amazing both solo and when playing with friends! You can catch hares and then fill the whole world of your friend with them! It's worth buying for this!I can confidently say that Terraria has become my corner of safety, this is my home, there is no place easier and quieter than it.Thanks Andrew Spinks, Whitney Spinks \u2764Thanks Re-Logic \u2764Thanks Terraria \u2764Thanks for reading \u2764",

It's not a game where players must fear losing progress due to forgetting safety measures or manage breakable tools. The game knows how to bring out a sense of enjoyment and achievement. Grinding is an option, not a requirement or an excuse to drag out game time. Besides, there is much to discover and do in the game. Clocking in at 1,000+ hours, having all 88 achievements, and introducing multiple friends to the game should be indicative of that. With that being said, I'll list some pros/cons I've found memorable.",

The content is beyond overwhelming with many bosses, challenges and options that you won\u2019t ever get bored of. The game revolves around  the player, as the difficulty and gameplay changes depending upon your progression. The art style and music are very exceptional, bringing us the fanbase pleasant memories even to this day.Terraria is a land full of mystery and wonder. You the adventure are given the task to cleanse this magical world from the spreading  called Hollow/Corruption. Many powerful beings will stand in your way, so grab some loot, find allies and restore the balance. Since many players forget the fact that Terraria includes a story in the first place. I suggest you to read the lore from the  in order to get accustomed with the plot.The actual Difficulty mode is a character setting selected during character creation. There are 5 types of difficulty: Softcore, Mediumcore, Hardcore and the newly added  mode that can only be played on journey worlds. All the above-mentioned modes change the penalty upon death.Another form of difficulty is  Those are a separate setting that apply to the  rather than the  Players may choose between Journey, Classic, Expert, and Master mode when creating a new seed. Each mode provides more loot, as well as special accessories depending on the difficulty you have chosen. I advise  players to start with the Classic mode, as Expert and Master are very demanding for a novice adventurer.Terraria starts its gameplay slow and steady, as it should be. You begin your journey with only 3 tools (sword, axe, pickaxe) at your disposal and a companion useful for his crafting guides. It\u2019s up to  the player whether you want to challenge the game, since your imagination, skill and creativity basically shape the word and thus the adventure. As a tip, I suggest you start building a small house in the beginning. \ud83d\ude09Terraria forces  the player to manipulate the environment in order to survive. You can chop trees used for crafting; mine rocks used for building or combine all the materials in order to cross large gaps etc. The physics play a major role in the game\u2019s playstyle, so do expect lots of deaths caused by  There is also a small detail concerning nightfall, but that\u2019s a surprise for you to explore. \ud83d\ude08Terraria refers to casual and hardcore players alike. You can slay forces or start creating buildings, without though being obliged to do so. The game offers a variety of blocks and items that encourage creativity. You can even build your own mini golf park! The goal here is to have fun and not just constantly grind for loot. \ud83d\ude01Overall, the experience is amazing, however the learning curve is extremely demanding. A feature that does not go well with many players. As you have noticed above, you  have to consult the  regularly in order to truly master the game. Otherwise, you going to encounter many problems and difficulties that eventually will lead to confusion. Terraria is  grind demanding game, so bring some friends in your journeys as co-op is more than encouraged!Terraria runs pretty well even on a  Pc. It is a small game with a gorgeous yet simple artstyle that continues to captivate me till this day. The game runs smoothly in low settings with minor loading times. In the rare case you encounter problems with performance, I suggest you turn off the effects.Terraria\u2019s music is  in its own way. Every biome, boss as well as event has its unique song that really fits the theme. I encourage you to buy  as it proves to be an excellent background music to listen to. You also provide a small token of appreciation to the developers. \ud83d\udc96Terraria is a challenging game for those who want to reach its completion. Before starting your adventure, I recommend you to get accustomed with terms like: Pre-Hardmode - Hardmode mode etc. The game takes time to master, so do not get disappointed if you are struggling in the beginning. Be patient and most importantly have fun.If you crave for more challenges the  (available on Steam) will become your best friend, so why don\u2019t you give it a try!!The below links are some content creators that gonna make you fall in love with the journey. They provide tips as well as tricks that prove very useful having them in your disposal :\u2022\t\u2022\t\u2022\tHaving in mind its low price compared to the amount of content that it offers, I consider Terraria a gaming paradise for both creative and challenge thirsty players. It refers to all ages, as it\u2019s unique gameplay encourages fun and creativity. You can build constructions, kill enemies, fight bosses, everything depends upon your playstyle. We are basically stealing a church!I need to express my enormous gratitude to Re-Logic, as their shear will and passion made this masterpiece relevant, with many updates and tweaks beloved by the community.- Kudos!!! \ud83c\udf78",

                "text": "Wow... 10 years...I wasn't the first Terrarian by a long shot, but my mother was among the ones in Beta/Alpha (I don't remember which one, I just know it was beginning stages). She played it, fell in love with its charm, and knew I would enjoy it as well, so a few months after its full release, she bought it for me as a gift. I fell in love, just as she did, the charm of the visuals, simplicity of the game play, the music that gives me nostalgia each time I hear it (especially the daytime track, those beeps and boops are forever ingrained in my head). I played for hours and hours just fiddling around, digging, exploring, creating more worlds to explore and dig into just for the fun of it. I played to the point I FAR surpassed my mother in Terraria knowledge, and she often asked me for help XD. I watched from the sidelines (as I was/am too shy to really go into the community) as the game grew, changed, and developed into what it is now. While I honestly do not play as much as I used to, I mostly played after big updates to play around and explore with the new content, I still hold those memories fondly, and I'm pretty sure I still have my first world out in my files somewhere.But that's enough story time, you came for my review:I can't recommend this game enough to ANYONE who has any interest in the genre, the pixel graphics are incredibly charming and cute, the controls might take a small amount of getting used to for some people unfamiliar with it, but they're not hard. The content is vast, you almost NEED to go into the wiki pages if you want to see it all. You can easily sink hours into the game if you're not careful, and literally explore worlds upon worlds of some fascinating procedurally generated landscapes and tunnels. The price of the game is definitely worth the amount of content you get.If there was anything I can think of (at this moment) that could be a downside, it might be that it could be a bit too easy to not know what to do, especially if you are playing on your own at first, and have no idea what you are supposed to do, there is a Guide NPC, but he doesn't exactly convey much about what needs to be done.Yet at the same time, that's part of the point, this game is about freedom, to do whatever you want in whatever way you want to do it.Happy 10 years, Terraria <3",

                "text": "To be completely honest, for years I did not like Terraria. The biggest problem with the game is you literally don't know what to do or how to progress in the game without looking up a guide on the Terraria Wiki, or by asking more experienced players. To me, I just find that as bad game design.  There could have been some sort of quest log that gave you some indication of what to do next, otherwise the beginning of the game becomes rather dull.Moving on, once you do know what you are doing, the game becomes surprisingly more enjoyable as Terraria focuses on combat and boss encounters. Each boss is different from one another, and are actually challenging. The game limits you from getting better gear until a specific boss is defeated which keeps the challenge high throughout.Apart from that, as you kill bosses new enemies and events will appear in the game unlocking a vast new variety of weapons, items, and equipment. One thing I had not realized is the incredible amount of content Terraria offers. As soon as you think you are done with the game, it just keeps going with even more bosses, more grind for even better gear, and just so much new stuff as you go along. (be sure to keep checking the wiki to see what bosses are next and how to unlock them)General overview:+ Loads of content+ Fun combat system with a large variety of weapons, spells, and gear.+ Lots of fantastic bosses+ Very challenging+ An ever-changing world with loads to explore+ Great fun with friends+ Very easy to host a server and game is very minimal on resources (meaning anyone with a PC can enjoy this, even on a laptop)- Somewhat impossible to progress without a guide- The first half of the game is rather boring compared to the later half- A bit straining on the eyes with pixel graphics, especially with a high resolution monitor- A bit too challenging at times (especially playing solo)- Resources are limited, meaning you won't be able to get items without generating a new world (your character can move between worlds and servers)  To sum things up, Terraria is a fantastic game to play with at least one friend (preferably just 2-4 ). It offers an extremely high amount of content, lots of bosses, fun gameplay, lots to explore and craft, and its cheap! +++ Highly recommend.",

You can build teleporters, find a hair dresser in a spider cavern, and get a sword that shoots cats. You can take on the lord of the moon using a yoyo, summon a sharknado minion that shoots sharks at your enemies, and find sky temples where air wyverns spawn. You can buy a music box from a wizard and go record the music that you like the most so you can have it playing in your base whenever you want, and then you can go build a castle made entirely out of white marble. It would seem the only thing Minecraft has over this game is 1 dimension. Trust me, once you get used to it and start learning about the game, Terraria is simply one of the most satisfying sandbox experiences out there. It may sound rude, but compared to this, Minecraft just has no imagination.",

                "text": "Objectively one of the most well-designed games on the market, right up there with Minecraft.TL;DR for people who hate reading: game good, buy it.Now, Terraria is often compared to Minecraft. However, these two games couldn't be more different. While both games share some similar mechanics, Minecraft has a heavy focus on creativity and survival, while Terraria has way more focus on combat depth and exploration. Lots of people call this game a \"sandbox game\", and I disagree with that. It's definitely more of a 2-D action RPG with sandbox elements. For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to be comparing and contrasting this game with Minecraft, since everyone and their mother is familiar with it and most people are gonna come to Terraria thinking it's just 2D Minecraft.So let's get into it, shall we? Minecraft has a straightforward gear progression system: Wood, Stone, Gold, Iron, Diamond, Netherite. Whereas Terraria has a very complex gear progression system that often gives you choices between gear sets. Gear and weapons are divided into different \"classes\": Ranged, Magic, Melee, and Summon. They're all equally viable, the only difference is that they all have different playstyles. Certain classes are better at certain fights than others, but in the end it all equals out. You won't even have access to all the gear sets or weapons in your first playthrough. This is because some of the ores and even biomes are randomly swapped out for something else entirely! For example, your world can either generate with Cobalt or Palladium, never both. So this gives the game tons of replay value if you want to experience everything, as different gear sets, weapons, and accessories often have different effects.Minecraft has two bosses, whereas Terraria has somewhere around twenty, all with different mechanics and a huge variety of strategies with which you can use against them. Unlike Minecraft, building and crafting actually facilitates the combat. By that, I mean that you can build a dedicated arena complete with platforms, regen stations, mana regen stations, defense buffs, etc. to aid you in combat, and you can customize it to your needs. Do you want to automate the boss-killing process? You can do that. Defeating certain bosses also gives you access to new gear, places, and items. All of this gives the player a sense of progression, like they're always working towards something. There's also plenty of optional bosses, as well as random invasions that you can tackle. In Minecraft, the attitude is very \"do what you want\", which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Terraria's philosophy is just different. You can do what you want, but if you want to access a wider variety of blocks to build with or just want something a bit more challenging, that's what the progression system is for.Next up are NPCs. Remember those Testificates in Minecraft that forced you to use a shoddy currency to buy low tier items for exorbitant prices? Well, Terraria does NPCs right. Terraria has a dedicated currency system unlike Minecraft (No, emeralds are not a dedicated currency system). This is your standard Bronze>Silver>Gold>Platinum MMO system. This currency is not mined, but is dropped from enemies. The NPCs in this game--and there are a lot of them--require you to build a house for them. Certain NPCs like/dislike certain biomes, and like/dislike certain neighbors. Each NPC has a unique function. For example, the Nurse will heal you to full health for a price, and the Clothier sells vanity items. Having two or more NPCs housed near each other will give you access to the pylon system, depending on how happy your NPCs are. Pylons are a teleport system designed to get you to house NPCs in several small villages throughout the world instead of all in one big base at your spawn point. Doing this will allow you to teleport to each of the villages you set up. This is a huge boon, because while the world isn't basically infinite like Minecraft's world, Terraria's worlds are still rather huge, and getting from point A to point B can be a really tedious task without these pylons.Terraria also has a looming, omnipresent threat that creates a sense of urgency once you defeat a certain boss. These are the infectious biomes, the Corruption, the Crimson, and the Hallow. These biomes will begin to spread throughout the world, and if you let them run amok for too long, they may well consume your entire world. The Corruption and Crimson biomes are evil, and will always be dangerous and hostile environments. These evil biomes spread like a cancer, and NPCs won't live anywhere near them, forcing you to constantly build and move NPCs to new houses if something isn't done about it.  The Hallow in particular isn't necessarily an evil biome like the Corruption or the Crimson, but allowing it to spread rampant can lock access to various items and blocks that you would otherwise need to gain an edge over the next boss. You will need to employ various strategies to either keep these infectious biomes at bay, or eradicate them completely. In contrast, Minecraft is extremely laid back, with no sense of urgency. Again, Terraria and Minecraft are two very different games.I could go on and on about the game's mechanics, but I've listed the main ones above. So, looking at the game objectively, here's my verdict. The character creation screen is sufficiently robust for the type of game that it is. You have multiple difficulty options, including Journey mode, which is a psuedo-creative mode with its very own progression system. The boss progression never gets too tedious and is always exciting whenever one spawns, as each one has a very different but heavy presence. The final boss is exceedingly challenging regardless of what difficulty you play on, which is honestly how it should be. After you complete progression on a world, you can start a sort of \"new game+\" in a new world, carrying over all your items and gear to the next if you so choose. I don't recommend this, as it basically breaks the game because difficulty does not scale with number of playthroughs on a single character, unless that's your thing. On a casual playthrough on a single world, it'll probably take you anywhere from 4 to 40 hours to beat, depending on what pace you like to go at. After that, you'll definitely want to play again and again. The pixel art is incredibly well done, especially with the recent overhaul. The music is some of my favorite in the video game industry, because it has such a unique personality. The community for this game is outstanding, and very alive. If you finished the game and want more out of it, Terraria does have mod support, so mod to your heart's content!I really couldn't think of anything about this game that I disliked. I mean, one could argue that sometimes the bosses expect a bit too much from the player. Or maybe you'll just get overwhelmed with the sheer amount of items you're going to pick up if you're a packrat. But I honestly can't think of anything that is objectively bad about this game. So yeah, I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone. My family and I play it together and everyone loves it. Terraria recently released their latest and final patch \"Journey's End\" which added an obscene amount of content to the game! Re-Logic really treats their playerbase well, and I definitely look forward to what they have to offer in the future.",

                "text": "Let's start the review with the obvious: go buy this game. Now, let's get to the review:Everybody (that doesn't play Terraria) says that this game is 2D Minecraft. Well, they're wrong. Terraria is like Minecraft but better in any way.Exploring feels like it should be: quick, simple and rewarding and the arsenal of tools like pickaxes, drills, ropes and torches makes that even more enjoyable. The environment is full of chests and vases that reward you just for walking around. You can also found Heart Crystals that boost your Max HP and Fallen Stars that boost your Max Mana.Combat feels clumsy at the beggining, but the more you play, the better it will get. The combat turns from a Copper Sword Stabby-Stab to Missiles, Bursts of Energy, Homing Bullets, Falling Meteorites, Massive Swords.Mining is as it should be: quick! You can spend only 5min just mining a rare ore, where in Minecraft, you will spend hours to find Diamonds and it depends on layers, stripminings, caverns, etc. In Terraria, you have things to help you find ore more easily, such as better tools, Pets that give you light, torches that highlight treasures, potions that show you where the treasures is, equipables that describe your surroundings, bombs/tnt that, for sure, help you get rid of the terrain and you don't feel that you've wasted your materials spending them.The Progression in this game is top notch. In the beggining you can't even beat a blob, but as soon as you grab some armor you can beat it easily. It's fun to discover that you're still too weak to walk to other biomes like the desert and jungle. And after you get comfortable with the gameplay, when you can beat every mob in the world, the game has the BALLS to strip that liberty away and put you in Noob Phase again. The switch between Pre-Hardmode and Hardmode is a huge step for gaming. It strips your sense of greatness without striping you off your items.The world, your map change with the flow of the game, new ores appear, the ore changes between worlds, so it is never the same, new mobs appear, corrupted biomes spread to other biomes, and if you don't pay attention, it will, eventually, take over the whole map.Even if you had explored the map previously, you will still explore the same areas because new ore, loot and enemies will appear. It never gets old being killed by Unicorns and Pixie Fairies. This is the first game where I do like brewing my potions, in Minecraft that function feels useless, either you don't use it at all, or you only use it for boss fights or breathing underwater. In Terraria you use them for everything. You use potions for Scaveging, Danger Hunting, Boss Fighting, Teleporting, Flying, Water Walking... It feels good using potions, and you don't feel cheated when you use them.Fishing is under appreciated. This mechanic is way better than Minecraft's or Stardew Valley's. You are not obligated to do it, but it will reward you with ore, vanity items, furniture, money, very good equipables, rods, bait, fish (that can be used for potions). It can be boring at times, but you don't even have to be alert, it functions with a simple mouse click.Building is god-like, you can build everything, you have all kinds of furniture, you can mold blocks with your hammer, and you can even paint all blocks in the game or create your custom biomes with paint. Even if you are bad at building and you'd like to build great things (like me) you can easily copy any screenshot of any building you see browsing the web. The houses you building will all feel comfortable.Wiring is like Minecraft's Redstone, but more simpler (sometimes). Wiring gives you the opportunity to build traps, build farms and teleport yourself around the map (yes, TELEPORT). Wiring also gives you motives to be careful when exploring caves because there might be traps lurking.Even if you play alone, your world feels alive, everywhere you go you have something. Wanna go left/right? You have Desert, Tundra, Jungle, Beaches, Meteorite, Hallow, Corruption/Crimson. Wanna go up? You have Sky Islands and Sky Lakes.Wanna go down? You have Granite, Marble, Spider-Nests, Mushroom Biomes, and even Hell (Underworld).The world isn't infinite like in Minecraft (I know it isn't infinite, but c'mon) but it still feels huge, and it even will change overtime with your adventure.Terraria will still offer you options like Pets, Light Pets, Mounts, Minecarts, Grappling Hooks and even Wings that you can collect if you feel like getting all the items.Even with all of this variety Terraria will offer events like Blood Moon, Solar Eclipse, etc which will give you another look at more new mobs, even more loot and even more fun. Some of the events change over time too, and offer great loot.And the bosses? Omg, the bosses are amazing. When you play, you're always thinking of when the new one's gonna come out. You'll get addicted to beat bosses, and Terraria has a fair share of bosses. In the beggining they feels kinda weak and easy, but it will change over time too. Bosses have themes behind them, Queen Bee is in the Jungle, Eater of Worlds is in the Corruption, Moon Lord appears after you defeat the Lunar Events, etc.Ah, and it even has multiple classes, and each and every one of them feels rewarding to play. Every one of them is fun to play, and the game doesn't force you to choose one of them at the beggining of the game, giving you time to experiment each class during your playtime.NPC's, in Terraria are very good and distinguished from each other. They don't look alike and don't \"NAH\" \"OH\" around. Each have their own personality and each one of them serves a purpose and gives life to your world, you will never feel alone.After all of this, you get another difficulty, which increases the difficulty (ofc), but increases the drop quality and it even gives you Expert only items that are worth the difficulty just for the items alone.The game feels rewarding and delivers in everything that is shown, and it is still being updated.This game is not grindy, you will only have to grind for specific items that are not required.And even with all of that, you still have mods. I have not experienced them, but everybody , in the Terraria community, knows that mods are god like. Mods like Calamity and Thorium are a must.And the Soundtrack is very good. Each biome has it's own theme, and it's very recognizable. You can tell the day/night cycle just by listening, or the biome you're in and the transitions between biomes are very well made. The bosses have their own themes too, but I'm always too busy fighting them so I don't even have the chance to listen.I've played so many games and I have NEVER seen a community like Terraria's. Everyone is so helpful, and the Youtubers are so memorable, from Happydays to Python and Grobeman.So, after reading my review, and looking at the \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" reviews for this game, what's your excuse for not buying? It's the best time to buy this game, it will get another update soon full with new stuff. This game is still relevant, \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665Seriously, why don't my friends like this game?!",

                "text": "When I first bought into Terraria, I was expecting 2D Minecraft. On the surface, that is essentially what it is, with buildings being done in 16-bit rather than a blocky visual style. However, the comparison to Minecraft ends at the construction element, as there is so much more to experience.Firstly, it looks gorgeous. This is 16-bit done very right, with sprites being well-defined and the world fitting together near-seamlessly. The combat is an area which could have been half-arsed, but wasn't. Initially, the variety is nothing to write home about, but it quickly expands to several weapons, from ranged to melee to magic and sometimes a combination of the three. Combine this with armour pieces, accessories, set bonuses and a crafting system where weapons can be combined to make new weapons (depending on recipes, mind), and you're left with an in-depth system for tooling yourself out with a myriad pieces of equipment. There's several boss fights too, whose defeat are pivotal to progression.While the worlds the game makes aren't infinite, they are all quite different from each other and you can save several of them at once, and you can visit any of them with a single persistent character, encouraging multiple worlds to find everything you need in terms of resources. NPCs are an important part of Terraria as they sell certain items which can't be acquired otherwise. In order to attract them, you need to build them a home, which ties into the construction aspect of the game rather well. You can make a lavish palace, a two storey flat or anything above or in between. The only limit to your creativity is the map limit, which is quite vast and allows space for many personal creations.I could go on gushing about Terraria, how it continues to be interesting regardless of what you're doing, how after killing all the bosses Hard Mode is unlocked, which populates the world with new tougher critters, and so on. Bottom line is, you owe it to yourself to play Terraria.",

This is an \"adventure\" game. The game  an adventure.A real adventure. Like when you take a shortcut through the wilderness, but end up further and further off path as you follow a stream, looking for a good place to cross.A real adventure. Like when you go hiking in the mountains and get lost. Only to realize it'll be quicker to get back to civilization by continuing forward, rather than returning the way you came.A real adventure. Like when you find yourself some place you've never been before, and with just a few tools, build yourself a makeshift home and defend it from zombies at night while exploring the world around you during the day. Eventually working your way underground into chasms filled with treasure and the occasional abandoned dwelling. Perhaps running across a giant beehive in an underground jungle or a buried pyramid under the desert. Finding your way deep into the darkness where the dead wander freely and mushrooms fluoresce brightly. Going deeper and deeper yet; to the point where the molten core of the planet lights up your eyes in a way only the sun had previously done.The hard part of writing a review for a game like this is not spoiling too much while still letting people know how deep the game actually is. So much of what I enjoyed about my first playthrough of this game was . Terraria might seem too simple when you first start out, and then possibly even overwhelming. But you'll be glad you spent effort to follow the stream or continue forward through the mountains.There's weapons and magic, but you never pick a class, like warrior or archer. Due to the wide range of weapons, accessories, and armor choices you'll suddenly realize at some point, perhaps when surrounded by your minions, that you've specialized as a summoner. Or that you're a wizard, or explosives expert. Or perhaps you're some unique archer-warrior hybrid. But your choices and discoveries have slowly lead you into your role; you never chose it from a drop down list.There's a multitude of biomes to discover. Each with their own unique enemies, and of course, epic boss fights. There's an incredible number of things you can do as you progress through the game. And while it plays fine single player, if you have a friend or two you can bring with you on this journey, you'll have that much more fun and they will thank you for it.Sure, you can spend hours upon hours building elaborate castles decorated with furniture you've crafted or statues you've collected from around the world. You can reshape the terrain around you - spreading biomes you like or cutting down those you don't. You can even bring biomes up from deep in the earth and set up the perfect potion mushroom farm right next to your base. One of my favorite things to do is to use the wiring system to set elaborate boobie traps around my fortifications. But you don't have to do  of that to progress. It's really all up to you. Although even if none of that is \"your thing,\" you might be so drawn in that you find yourself happily engaged in such activities.And yes, a big part of the game is digging, but it's primarily a means of exploration. A means of reaching that next treasure chest, or cluster of gems. A means of reaching the next deep fissure in the earth. A great adventure awaits you.",

Thank you.If you'd like to skip straight to Pro's & Con's, please move to the bottom of the page. Thank you.  With the release of Update 1.3, Terraria has become three hundred times better. Update 1.3 adds in loads of new items, monsters, bosses, events, and more. The new bosses are a really big challenge and very cleverly done. The addition of achievements is addicting to any player who loves to hunt achievements, like myself. Including the new gamemode known as \"Expert Mode\" which is basically like turning the difficulty up to 'brutal'. Lots of other changes as well, like new textures and sounds, and the new addition of world stats to keep track of how many of each type of monster you kill (Which now rewards you with banners). I found out about Terraria the same way I use to always find games, YouTube. I randomly came across a video called \"Terraria\". I took a look, and instantly fell in love with what I saw, and knew I had to have the game for myself. It looked like a great combination of gerne' that I love to bits. Being a Minecraft fan since the beggining of Alpha, I knew I  have it.When ever you ask someone about Terraria, read a review, or watch a video, 95% of the time you hear \"Minecraft clone\" or \"2D Minecraft\". Which is incorrect on so many levels. If you have heard this many times, and are thinking twice about actually playing Terraria, please read on as it is nothing like Minecraft.  Terraria is a very unique game for what it does. There have been games like it in the past, but the amount of content and play ability is beyond anything I've ever seen before. Terraria is a , , , etc. 2D game. It does it's thing very well. I haven't noticed any UI bugs, or ones that I have, are fixed almost instantly after the patch is released. The gameplay it provides is not only smooth, it is addicting and fun. The combat system in the game is perfect for me, and a lot of others. There are so many enemy types in this game that are not copy paste, each one  and has  Example on the kind of enemies you could come across. Normal walking/running enemies, that have a soul objective to charge you until death. These may include enemies like the  or .As there are other enemies who will do the same thing, but in a different way (So not everything is copy/paste.). Like the  enemy type, which come in many varieties, which will bounce towards you. Or the  enemy type, which will walk on the ground, but can also climb on the walls to get to you quicker. Just to name a few.\"Well, how do I defend myself against these enemies?\"Good question. Let's get that.This is where Terraria gets big. Even though the world's are limited, they provide so much that you could spend 800 hours of game time on a single  and still have many things to do.In the world of Terraria, there are alternate versions of almost everything. What I mean by this is, each world you have will not be the same. For example, there is a 50/50 chance when loading a world to have the default version of something, or the alternate. Such as the music that plays, there are different tracks for the same biomes, just depends on what random one you got. Or for textures on things like, grass, and trees. Also things like ore, in a default world you would have Copper as your basic ore, but in an alternate world, you'd have Tin as your basic ore. What this does is really expands the play time someone can spend in Terraria. Allowing a single person to play the game over and over, and never have the same experience. Below the surface are loads of blocks, dirts, ores, and more. Ore like Copper, Tin, Lead, Iron, Silver, Platinum, Gold, Cobalt, etc. And blocks like normal dirt, clay, stone, mud, cobwebs, and so many more. You need these ores to make your weapons and armor. You can find treasure deep underground, that holds many valuable things. You can increase your maximum health by finding  underground.The weapon range in this game is massive. You even have magic weapons, like spell books, and mana weapons. There are also bows, swords, pickaxes, axes, guns, lazers, cannons, familiars, and so much more.I won't get into to much detail here, but the amount of content in this game is massive, and it's still being updated. Sure, Terraria has been through some rough times with updates, but when it gets an update, the update is full of new things and changes. Overall, Terraria is a great game that you can spend hours of time in, and still be having fun in many years to come. It's a steal for the price of $9.99, and especially when there is a sale that lowers the game to $2.00 or less. This game is definitely a choice for sandbox gamers looking for an easy to slip into, addicting experience. Pro's:+Loads of content for hours of game time.+Great combat system.+Smooth gameplay, that's easy to slip into.+Provides a good challenge.+Fun and creative boss battles.+Amazing side events that you cannot resist.+Achievements are addicting to those achievement hunters.+Expert & Hardcore modes add hundreds more hours of gameplay and possibility.Con's:-No infinite world option. (Doesn't drop overall score - But can be annoying to some players)-No easy way to edit worlds before creation (Like choosing whether to have Crimson or Corruption)Overall Rating: Is about a 14.5/15 (Must Own!)Thank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope this helped out with your decision on whether to make a purchase or not.Remember, this review is based off of opinion only. You may not think the same way as me towards something, but that's okay, because we are all human.",

We all knew this was coming, after 1.3 came with the true endgame it was only a few years' time for the finale.Back when I first joined, I was a little guy. Started playing back in the 1.1 days. I learned the ropes, and I had a lot of fun. Most of my time was occupied by another childhood favorite, Minecraft, however I played this quite often too. I found a server, and started playing some minigames, meeting people, and fighting bosses with them. Those times were great.Then came 1.2, a glorious time. I started my first true playthrough, as a ranger, and was determined to beat the Golem, which I did after some time. I ended up painting my entire spawn in negative colors because I was bored. Those were also fun times.After that came 1.3, the endgame. I wasn't playing it much during this time, due to not being able to use a computer, but I played it and it was enjoyable nonetheless. I met more people, played more games, did more playthroughs, and I ended up getting into mods.But eventually, things go as they come.1.4 is a bittersweet update, to say the least. It made the game look so much better, and performed smoother overall too. The changes added were astronomical, but nothing truly game-changing, well except for Empress of Light. The new Master mode is okay, but it lost so much potential it could have had. x10 spawnrate is also fun, but I only put some 40 hours into that. Got pretty far, but it just got too strenuous, with school starting up and all too.A game I once knew to be simply three mechanical bosses and some hallowed gear changed into the vibrant landscape it is today, but never to change anymore. It's one of many relics lost to time of my childhood, and one that will go in my mind as a great memory collection, yet not to be added to much more. I might play this game here and there, but it just isn't what it used to be.May I wish you all good luck in your virtues, and hope you all have a great time, as I once did. Just don't get it get to your heart too much, otherwise it will pull hard.",

                "text": "Humanity is responsible for some of the worst atrocities imaginable. Genocide, war, slavery, those complete degenerates who shove gum on the underside of tables. But there are some things humans have accomplished that just completely balance out the bad \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 that they do. We have constructed flying machines, built gigantic skyscrapers, we've been to the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 moon. But the magnum opus, the peak of human accomplishments lies in Terraria. Terraria is nothing less than a genuine masterclass of video games, and it is a crime that this game costs only ten dollars. Nintendo charges 60 dollars for New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe, which is a port of a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Wii U game which was already made from copy pasted elements from previous 2D Mario games in the first place, and this mind-blowing gem sells for 1/6th the price. Terraria has so much variety, so high a skill ceiling, so seamless a difficulty transition that it is nearly impossible to get bored of it. At the beginning of the game, you're fighting a big slime wearing a crown using this pathetic bow you made from some rocks you found underground. At the end of the game, however, you are fighting a god of death firing laser beams and eyeballs of death, while you are zooming around on a UFO shooting him in the forehead with a machine gun crafted from the fragments of a destroyed otherworldly pillar where you were shot at by mutant bugs that can cause your gravity to go out of wack when they get a hit in. The fact that the transition from the big slime to fighting actual gods is so seamless is nothing short of incredible, and the difficulty progression follows suit in its incredible execution. The game starts off so mindlessly easy, a toddler would scoff at it and play through effortlessly while blindfolded and missing multiple limbs. Then your first boss comes in and it's a little harder, you die a few times, but nothing that bad, But then as time goes on, the bosses increase in difficulty over time, to the point where you are dodging the gigantic lasers and eyeballs of death from the god of death mentioned earlier. But because the difficulty increase is so subtle, it never feels overwhelming. Although there are some difficulty dips from time to time, Golem being a prime example of this, there are very few difficulty jumps. The three difficulty modes are also very well integrated as well. It's almost like each mode is a continuation of the last, the beginning of expert is about as hard as the end of normal, and the beginning of master is about as hard as the end of expert. And I haven't even mentioned how much \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 this game has. Thousands of items, hundreds of weapons, hundreds of enemies, events, bosses, dungeons, you fight the god of torches at one point. I've been playing this game for quite a while, I lost count, I think I have like 3 hours on it or something, and this game is still hitting me with things I didn't know previously existed. And the worlds of Terraria are huge, with many nooks and crannies to shove your dirty little fingers into, so you'll likely get a ton of playtime out of each individual world. And once you are done with one world, you make a new one, but with the added knowledge of the previous world under your belt. Maybe you learn how to better your constructions, maybe you learn how to exploit an enemy's AI in your favor. Learning how Terraria works and all the mechanics at play is so satisfying and so fun to employ, that it has kept me entertained for years, and is likely to keep me entertained for many years more. If you haven't gotten this game yet, please do. You're missing out on one of the greatest games ever created.",

As a player who had experienced the vanilla and the mod variant, I\u2019ll be commenting for both game experiences.The vanilla [original] game present you with the basic components of how to play. While it can be a grind at the start to gather materials to build, in the later game you\u2019ll be introduced to more content, new areas, enemies and NPCs. The game is hugely focused on progression, which makes it quite an addiction to play. My favorite aspects of the game are the weapons and gear, plus the boss battles. No item is ever the same, as well as the monsters that we face. The aesthetics are also nice; the Plantera mask and kimono were one of my personal favorites to dress for my character. Lots of items in the game are customizable, including colour changes to upgrades for bonus stats.Now, for the mod version, there were even more available content for players. The mods my friends and I played with on his server were namely the Thorium Mod and Calamity mod. These mods added features such as more boss monsters, items, NPC and more. Some players will frown at mods and call it \u201ccheats\u201d and whatnot. However, this is not the case as it brings more complexity to the original game, and it's not intended for new players anyways. We played on Expert/Revengeance mode and fought additional bosses like Astrium Deus, and the Siren and Leviathan. In my experience, the modded variation provided and even more thrilling challenge than the Vanilla version. I recommend trying it after you\u2019ve completed the original game.In general, Terraria is a must-play for anyone who hasn\u2019t done so.",

Now, most people would probably look at this game and think it's just 2D Minecraft, but it is so much more than that. The main similarities are in the blocks and survival aspects of it. But beyond that Terraria is just so much more.Summary:Gameplay - [9] When you start a world for the first time it is a very slow game, but the game quickly picks up the pace. There is no hand-holding in this game whatsoever, you have to do everything yourself or check the Terraria wiki page. You change a lot during your adventure and in the end the game is very fast-paced.Soundtrack - [10] The soundtrack is some of the best I've ever heard in a sandbox game. It's so simplistic yet so good. It is very catchy and I will never forget the iconic song Overworld Day which is instantly recognized.Graphics - [10] Since it isn't aiming for realistic graphics you really cannot give it a bad score. It's a very specific kind of art style that fits the game very well.Price - [10] The price is incredibly cheap compared to what you get. You get a really long game with a bunch of replay value. It costs 9,99\u20ac on Steam but often goes down to 4.99\u20ac during sales. It's a great price.In conclusion: Terraria is a fantastic game that has everything you would ever want in a game like this. You should really buy this if you want a really good sandbox game. The developers have been supporting this game for years now and still have 1 last update left called Journey's End. Thanks for reading this review.",

It might be relatively old now, but it's truly a great game to pick up to play alone or with friends.This is the game I end up coming back to from time to time, as it provides lots of fun and many different things to do. Build, craft, fight, gather materials or items - it's all up to you. It's even more fun when you get into it with friends. The amount of content this game has to offer is enormous; fights are exciting, building is fun and highly enjoyable, finding various items is always nice. You can have fun things such as mounts and pets, or even a sword that shoots cats. Generally a super fun game with many possibilities.Summary:- LOTS of content.- Can be enjoyable even if you want to play alone.- A lot of stuff to do and places to explore.- Different content difficulties.- Might be confusing at the start, but gets super fun when you figure out things.- Huge amount of various in game items.- Soundtrack is one of the most enjoyable I've heard.- Plenty of different NPCs that will end up invading your home.- Possiblities for building are endless. It's very enjoyable and you can experiment with all kinds of blocks and decor.Overall, this is an amazing sandbox game, with pretty much endless possibilities, and I highly recommend it!",

I met a lot of people and learned so many things through these friendships and communities and practically gone through what seems like the virtual equivalent to my childhood, so wow does this game have a special place in my heart.Putting my sentimental values in this game aside, content-wise this game is practically everything a fantasy-loving, retro game, sandbox, adventurous and architectually creative enthusiast could ever ask for (see if you're not a fan of any of those kind of games, then you probably might not enjoy this considering the beginning is rather.. slow). Gosh there's just so much to love in this game that I don't even know where to begin, that is, if you give this game a chance. I shall warn anyone who isn't a fan of reading guides that the game in the beginning isn't very intuitive, as it just throws you in the world with no tutorial whatsoever. However there is a Guide NPC, so if you do feel lost on what to do, you should speak to said NPC. The controls of this game is pretty basic; WASD to move, space to jump, number keys corresponding to the hotbar, click to attack, etc.But once you got all of that figured out, boy is this game one heck of a ride, especially if you haven't read any spoilers and you have absolutely no idea what will happen next in this gem of a game. You'll be quite surprised with how many things you can discover, how many things you can create and conquer; I definitely recommend you play this with friends as progression throughout the game would be so much more funner, meaning you'll get to the fun stuff faster (i.e. the events and ridiculous weapons and mounts).",

Ah ... What an adventure. You start by cutting down a tree and building a small rectangle for your first npc friend in the game, and you end up fighting aliens, crazy cultists, and other mad things. I thought I was getting into a relaxing game that wouldn't bother me at all, but ... well, I can say that there were some bosses who got me on my toes. \u2022Crafting in this game is the thing that made the biggest and best impression to me. There are so many things you can do other things with ... When you're at the beginning of the game, it can swallow you. The most important thing is not to worry about using the internet in this game. The right way to play is with 25 tabs in Google Chrome open at the same time while trying to find the right item to craft.  \u2022At the beginning of the game, it is very important to build platforms that can be used to avoid the attacks of the bosses. I haven't played the game before this last patch, but as far as I've seen, videos showing people defeating bosses in an \"easy\" way with minimal movement are now updated and not working, so your mechanics will play a key role in your playthrough. Here may be the time to mention that I personally played in Expert and I was not alone, but \u0430 duo with a friend of mine. After the last patch of the game there are a total of 104 achievements. A lot of them can be completed while preparing for bosses, end game, etc. Others want you to craft an item or do something, not that hard. In general, the achievements are not so difficult and can also be a good guide when you are wondering what to do. However, there is one achievement that will haunt you. HELPER MINION is the name of this nightmare. Remember this name and when you get into the game and have only this achievement left, come back to this review and leave a comment. The day I write this review I have 170 hours in the game and I am on quest number 158. Almost there, buds.Honestly, I haven't tried the game in classic mode, but in expert mode it's not that easy, so I don't want to think about how it will be in master mode. However, if you do not have much time and just want to relax in the game, there is a mod\u0435 for that. It was added in the latest patch 1.4 and is called journey mode. There a lot of things are made much easier and non-committal. In short, the game is as difficult as the player wants it to be.The game is as beautiful as 2D graphics allow it to be. I find many of the things that can be found in the world of  to be quite sweet and beautiful. has over eighty music tracks across every version of the game. Each one will play and loop endlessly while the player is in a specific biome or while certain events are taking place. All the music in  was composed by Scott Lloyd Shelly of Resonance Array. I didn't have to play music from YouTube at all, so I find the game's music good and fitting.I had no problems at all.Game tested on:The game itself is cheap and definitely worth the full price, so if you think you want to play it a lot, don't hesitate and take it. Waiting for a discount is also not a bad idea to save some money, but be sure to take this game. For the time you can spend in it, this amount of money is negligible.",

                "text": "This is one of the best games ever made and the only reason it is not regarded as such is that it is not very accessible. I can imagine many critics have started Terraria, played for some hours trying to figure it out, and put it away. Very often, critics have drawn misguided conclusions that Terraria resembles Minecraft (or is a Minecraft clone), but in fact nothing could be further from the truth. Terraria is a procedurally generated sandbox survival metroidvania. Learning curve is steep, the game is hard and often requires you to consult to wikis and guides (even more so than the Souls series) but once you gain control of the game mechanics, you will find a very deep, hard core gem. Don\u2019t let its eye-candy graphics fool you\u2026You are dropped into a world surrounded by many dangers. Initially, you are expected to make your first shelter, first weapon and just survive. This is the very core of the whole game. In order to beat stronger creatures, you need better weapons for which you need better crafting material. To get better crafting material, you need to mine deep into the earth, which leads you to find secret chests, face gazillion creatures including \u201cbosses\u201d. Boss fights not only require skill, but also need you to have the weapons, armors, potions, items necessary to beat them. Last, but not the least, there are plenty of events such as Halloween, Christmas, Pirate Invasion etc. with their own unique bosses and loots.While you are working on mining for better tools, armors, weapons to be able to beat stronger enemies, you also need to keep expanding your \u201cshelter\u201d. A chair, ceiling and door is not sufficient any longer. You need to keep building new rooms to have room for new crafting centers and chests (for inventory). Every new room invites a new NPC to your shelter who can be crucial in your quest to beat the world of terraria, whether they sell unique items or provide healing.Being a true sandbox game, you can also ignore progression and spend hundreds of hours just building. Your limit to what you can build and how you can customize it is your imagination. People at Terraria subreddit still manage to amaze me with their creativity and sometimes totally mind-blowing architecture. Whether you choose to play it as a metroidvania or as a sandbox 2d Minecraft, you will love Terraria. In my opinion, it is one of the best games ever made. Buy it full price. Developers are still updating content and supporting the game after all these years (without any paid DLCs whatsoever), they really deserve some support.",

Different style of play than FO3 or FO4, which up until now I used as a standard for playing games. I did not care for Metro 2033 so I did not pay much attn to these games. A friend said try it so I did and boy am I happy about that. Talk about a game you can put yourself into and become fully immersed, this is it and the artwork and graphics were incredible. Some things I did not care for but the good so far outweighs the bad it is not worth mentioning the bad. VERY NICELY DONE. I am keeping this installed and will play it again when I finish some others. (EDIT) I stated I did not care much for Metro 2033, I was wrong. I am playing the redux now and love it. Someone said to read the books, as soon as I am finished playing 2033, Last Light and Exodus in the proper order this time, I am going to do just that.I just completed the series in the proper order, playing Exodus for the second time. I found it this time around even more magnificent than I did the first. I have experienced MANY thing in my many years so there is not a lot that will get to me. No game I have ever played affected my very inner being as this one has. I know of nothing else I can say without sounding like I am rambling so my last words will be WOW, absolutely f***ing WOW!!!!!",

                "text": "is the third installment of the acclaimed series, inspired to the books of Dmitry Glukhovsky, and set after the events of Metro last Light. Once again impersonating Artyom, players will soon leave the cryptic tunnels of the Moscow Metro to journey on through the entirety of Russia, ending up in a variety of places ranging from deserts to lush forests - accompanied by Colonel Miller and his elite Spartan team. What initially begins as a daring escape soon turns out to be a journey for survival, as unexpected turns of events one after another come crashing down on the squad.\ud83d\udfe9 \ud83d\udfe5 Starting with the good points, the strongest feature of Exodus as it was with the prequels, is the atmosphere and world-building, which deliver an uncompromisingly realistic take on the nuclear post-apocalypse. This time it's not confined to the cramped Metro tunnels, but shows in full the entirety of Russia's wastelands, and does so flawlessly. Fighting any kind of enemy on the higher difficulties is a tense and unforgiving affair, where all but the weakest attacks mean certain death for both yourself and most enemies. This realism is complemented by accurate gunplay and good variety of murder tools to use. Exploring the wastelands is not only spectacular but also worthwhile, as every map contains a bounty of secondary locations often hiding unique upgrades for Artyom's suit and weapon mods. They will make your life easier once acquired. The narrative and characters stay true to the excellent book series and do not disappoint in the slightest.There are however a few dents to an otherwise flawless execution. The Karma system has been reworked and forces players to take on the majority of situations with complete stealth, without also killing anyone in order to get the good ending. This goes as far as penalizing you for killing someone that shot first and is openly hostile, while the consequences will influence your companions' very lives as if some \"higher power\" was there to punish you - which makes no sense. \ud83c\udfae Gameplay is divided into Exploration, Character Management, Quests and Combat.Is performed on foot most of the time, except in a particular map where there will be a truck at your disposal. Ziplines and boats are also used sparingly to traverse otherwise impossible paths. While exploring, keeping an eye out for mechanical and chemical components - both used in crafting - is one of the primary goals, as you'll need them to craft supplies. Of course you can also find already made ammo, medkits and filters, but that's a more rare occurrence. Certain specific places hold unique modifications more or less hidden, and this is what makes exploring every corner worthwhile. A global map will display your position and all the discovered points of interest, highlighted on the map by using the Binoculars on a high place. Safehouses are sparingly set around the world and they can offer a safe refuge to wait night or day, craft at the workbench and more importantly save the game if you play Hardcore. There is no fast travel.Can be done on the fly with the portable workshop in your backpack, or in a more complete manner at a stationary workbench in a Safehouse. You will be able to modify any of your weapons with previously acquired mods at any time, as well craft simple ammo types such as arrows or steel balls, medkits and filters. More complex crafting requires a full bench and that includes changing your suit upgrades, crafting bullets and as well throwables like grenades, cleaning weapons to prevent malfunction.Are not numerous in the game and usually are about retrieving a specific item for one of your travel companions or another character. They do not always award anything other than achievements or Karma, but still they are worth doing for the sake of storyline and to explore new places.Is one of the most consistent elements of the experience and at least on the higher difficulties, is a brutal and unforgiving affair where even just one shot can instantly kill you, as well as enemies. Ammunition is fairly limited, while grenades and throwables are powerful bit very expensive to create - using all your resources, stealth as well, is key to prevail against overwhelming numbers. Nothing prevents you from going in guns blazing but on higher difficulties it's a good idea to take out at least some enemies silently before doing so. Foes range from your average bandit with a shotgun to nine feet tall abominations with the strength of twenty men, passing from mutated shrimps and venomous giant worms. Each foe has strengths and weaknesses for you to exploit, for example most animals will be scared by fire or your vehicle. Human enemies are definitely smart and use tactics such as flaking, cover and grenades to overpower you, other than having swift reflexes and excellent aim - on Hardcore at least. Being accurate, fast and conservative are the pillars of Metro's combat. None. Resource usage is within expected parameters for the quality, no problems to report. The game runs without issues in 1440p, 85Hz on Ultra settings.  Key rebinds do not work properly for certain keyboard configurations. Save system on Hardcore difficulty has frequency issues, might be a bug, unconfirmed.Metro Exodus is definitely a worthy successor that expands the prequels' gameplay, taking it to new heights, but not without some drawbacks. Fans of the series and those who like atmospheric games will not be disappointed.",

                "text": "As i grow older, i tend to lose motivation to play games since alot of them aren't even fun anymore and i usually have to force myself to play them. But THIS game is an absolute must play, i absolutely loved every second of it. Some people may be scared off because of the change from linear gameplay to a more open-world type gameplay unlike it's predecessors. But i think they executed this change of pace perfectly.The gameplay is basically the same as the previous games, they added a cool crafting system (that somehow magically turns some random chemicals and metal into gas mask filters and ammo). Your guns can get jammed if you don't clean them often and you have to manually unjam them, sand, snow, and even falling in water affects how fast your gun gets dirty. Your gas mask can get damaged too, and if it cracks you can repair it with duck tape (it's only temporary though), and unlike the previous games you can't pick up a new mask, you will have to repair this one at a workbench.The morality system makes a comeback, but there's not alot of moral points to be earned in each chapter, most of it is straight forward unlike the previous games (also as a tip, listening to dialogues won't give you morality points, but it can give you sidequests and cool marks on the map).The locations are really cool, there's a chapter for each season of the year, and you get to experience quite some interesting landscapes, ranging from snowy landscapes to desert places. I'd say the first chapter (The Volga) is probably the Highlight of the game, but that does NOT mean the other chapters are boring.I haven't encountered any major bugs, most of the bugs i've encountered were physic bugs, and those were extremely rare, there are some game breaking softlock bugs supposedly, so make sure to back up your saves as you progress (i made a special folder where i kept all my saves from the beginning of the game to the end)The best aspect of the game for me is probably how immersive it is, i haven't been immersed in a game like this in a really long time, in my opinion, i'd say it even takes the spotlight away from the first game.And it's not only the \"horror\" elements of immersion, it's the family and friends aspect as well, drinking and playing the guitar with your friends on the train was one of the most real scenes i've ever seen in a video game, and i am so glad that a video game could capture that beautiful feeling.Okay i'm getting quite stupidly philosophical there, to wrap it up, this game is AMAZING. It absolutely blew my mind, i thought it would kinda disappoint me after the first two amazing games, but it's quite the contrary. I think this is my favourite metro game, and i absolutely recommend it even at full price.P.S. I highly recommend playing this game on the Ranger Hardcore difficulty as with all the metro games, not only does it help you immerse better, but i think it's the best way to experience this masterpiece of a game.",

                "text": "At first glance, Metro: Exodus (MEx) might seem like a typical FPS with a couple of twists, and while it doesn\u2019t really offer anything groundbreaking, it is a perfect example of a whole package being greater than the sum of its parts.::Unless you want yet another FPS with some extended features, you should most definitely play this game on . Having played through the game twice, I decided to try Normal and, let me tell you straight away that this is most definitely not the way you should experience MEx.Not only is the game too forgiving but , which makes it stand out in the oversaturated FPS crowd, become basically non-existing. Just imagine if Dark Souls had Skyrim\u2019s quest pointer.If you\u2019re uncomfortable with a very challenging setting, pick the one that you\u2019re OK with and go a step above in order to maintain the pressure and the idea of a harsh and unforgiving post-nuclear world. I\u2019ve heard someone saying how , and I could not agree more. With that being said, let\u2019s dig in, shall we?The Franchise previously known for its predominantly claustrophobic and linear levels becomes very open-ended in its latest iteration. From this, it\u2019s easy to assume that there are going to be some big changes, and, I for one, welcome and absolutely loved those. Thematically, this is still a Metro game. There are even a number of linear sections and levels, such as the game\u2019s opening, where you have to play as it is intended and have little to no say so in how things develop. Gameplay-wise, the foundation is there, just that it has been expanded and improved upon, but the overall feel was quite different for me. Being dubbed the best scout in the unit, Artyom, the game\u2019s protagonist, has a lot to live up to, and MEx provides plenty of opportunities to do just that. Wandering the outskirts and the wilderness, scouting for points of interest and noting them down on your map for later exploration is a very important and big part of the experience. In fact, depending on your playstyle, scouting, exploration, and scavenging might as well be the major part of your MEx playthrough, and this is actually pretty cool.Now let\u2019s add a high level of immersion to this. I\u2019m talking about no HUD. This means no objective tracker on your screen, or a mini-map full of colorful icons to pop. No distraction whatsoever while exploring. You go where you think that something of interest might be. Of course, you can still access the map and check the objective tracker. You have your visibility indicator for stealth and the Geiger counter as well as many other indicators. The thing is, they\u2019re presented in a very immersive way. They\u2019re all gadgets, mostly on your wrist, audio and visual cues which are a part of the game world, and when you see or hear those, nothing is reminding you that while all of this is cool, you\u2019re still playing a video game.Even though MEx puts you on an open level, it is still not an open-world game. In fact, these open areas are big levels that, once you\u2019re done with, you may never return to. This is why you might want to let your FOMO take over and take your time to make sure you\u2019ve visited every nook and cranny. Why? Because this is how you progress, for the most part. The game will  so pay attention to what your comrades are saying!You don\u2019t exactly level up in MEx. There are no perks to unlock or XP to grind. However, there are still ways to improve your character, like gadgets, suit upgrades, and weapon parts. Finding new weapon parts is a big deal, as the game lets you customize guns in the field. Considering various enemy types, different weather conditions and the impact that the time of the day has on the world of MEx, this is quite useful. Need a medium-range rifle instead of a silenced pistol? Strip down your revolver, and make a couple of adjustments! Swap the silencer for a long barrel, add the 2X Scope on it's rail, and you've got yourself a rifle. If you've searched thoroughly, you will have everything you need, and can improvise to adapt to any given situation. Once obtained, these upgrades can be used through the entire game.Others are given to you as the story progresses. You might actually want to stick to the main objective until you\u2019ve obtained the binoculars, at which point you\u2019ll be properly equipped and have everything you need to explore the world on your own.When it comes to the story, perhaps more than the content of it, I like the fact that it\u2019s rather believable. Listening to the Artyom\u2019s comrades speak about what was going on is what I enjoyed the most, as they were all lovable characters with a lot of personality.The adventures of Aurora\u2019s crew and their objectives feel like they are happening spontaneously. They were logical conclusions and decisions based on the current events and situation that I never found to be forced on the game simply because the developers needed some excuse to blow things up or shoot someone.  Player choices and their consequences, which the game always had (to an extent), are done better and more clearly telegraphed to the player this time around, although there\u2019s still room for some improvement.  The exploration, which I\u2019ve brought up so many times already, also extends to the story as some story-related things require to be found first. It is also the best way to gain additional Karma points which will determine how the story unfolds and eventually ends.  Of course, I am recommending this game. I\u2019ve played it multiple times and actually plan to give the recently released raytracing-only version a go sometime down the road.  However, keep in mind what I\u2019ve said at the beginning: unless you make this game unforgiving, you\u2019ll be mowing down enemies and playing a post-apocalyptic shooter, which is not really that impressive nowadays anymore.  My impressions are based on the very specific Ranger Hardcore mode with Minimal Interface. This made the game slow, methodical and unforgiving, which is something that I very much enjoy. Ammo was scarce, just like the resources, I had to make every bullet count, and when I made a mistake, it was punished severely. At times it reminded me of the good times when I played Metal Gear Solid 3 back in the day on my PS2. When I scoured around for resources and ammo, waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike. MEx is, in many ways, just like that, and if this sounds like something you\u2019d like to experience, then, by all means, get it, play it, and love it.",

                "text": "This is one of the few series of games I have ever played where the next installment is better than the last. Normally, this is not the case, but Metro is a no ordinary game. The story really makes you feel a part of Artyom's family. Over the course of the series you bond with Artyom's mates in a way that feels closer than family. You care about everyone's well being and you want to play through the story to make sure everyone remains safe. Not only that, but the development of each and every individual character is wonderful. There's a lot of depth to them and you hear it in random conversations when you stumble upon them or smoke with them on the train ride. Hearing every word that everyone has to say any time really does mean a lot. The Soundtrack. I can not justify verbally how incredible the soundtrack is for this game. The emotion, the feeling, the atmosphere, the intensity is something that sounds like it was composed by a supernatural deity who knew music better than any human composer. The soundtrack perfectly harmonizes with the atmosphere of the game and setting that you find yourself in.I honestly cannot get enough of this series. I played with Xbox Game pass on PC (88 hours) and waited to buy it on steam to show my fellow Ukrainian Developer my support!One of the few 10/10 games I would say that is more than deserving of that rating.",

I never saw any videos or trailers of it so I had no idea what to expect. I was completely blown away. The graphics in this game are stunning. Thus also requiring quite a machine to run it. I have the RTX 2060 super so i had no problem running it but my friend tried it with GTX 760 and had 30 fps on average on low settings.STORY AND CHARACTERS:Another strong point of the game is story. It is a character driven story and the game does a lot to make us connected to our companions. Between the missions I just stopped and listened to their conversations and banters and i just couldn't go on until they stopped. Each character has an interesting and distinct background and character, that surprisingly isn't bland and doesn't end up being a caricature. Relationships between the characters are amazing, and at certain moments one could get a teary eye.In some places the plot falls a bit thin but then the characters relationships save them.DIFFICULTY:The game offers several difficulties to play with, which dictate the amount of ammo found in the world, how much damage you can take, how much health do enemies have... I played it on the normal difficulty and although it wasn't really hard, there were a few moments where i felt really vulnerable. But the real challenge comes with the Hardcore ranger, with it's rare ammunition, HUD turned off and constant sense of danger. GAMEPLAY:The gameplay style is largely dictated by the difficulty and area. It goes from straight up shooter to almost horror stealth style. The gunplay is smooth, although i liked it a bit more in previous games of the series. The iconic weapon upgrades make a return, but i miss the unique currency in the shape of Military grade ammo. Stealth is really polished, but at some moments enemies randomly see you through a wall (happened to me only once or twice). I didn't really like the crafting but I guess it fits the open world style of those sandbox areas. At the end of the day it's still the original, slightly clunky Metro gameplay.AUDIO:Lastly I want to talk about the sound design. The soundtrack is phenomenal. It sets the mood for the game so nicely. It pumps intensity in certain moments and dread and sadness at others. It's one of the best soundtracks i heard in recent years. And the audio in general is really polished and high quality. Really a pleasure to ears.tl;drI really enjoyed the game. The gameplay is enjoyable, be it shooting or stealth. The audio and graphics are phenomenal, but it needs a newer pc to fully enjoy the latter (although even on low and medium the game still looks amazing). The main game is about 25-30 hours long if you do some exploration, 15 more with dlcs. I think the game is well worth the price, but if you can get it on sale (i bought the gold edition for 25\u20ac) then it's a must buy.",

Although there's a bit of a setback in terms of Gameplay (In my opinion), Metro Exodus is still a game that I will vividly remembers for the years to come.",

                "text": "Let's get this out of the way: Removing the game from Steam two weeks before launch and making it an Epic exclusive was a stupid, greedy and anti-consumer decision. Shame on you Deep Silver for doing that. Many people will not be able to enjoy this fantastic game because of you. Now, on to the review.I love the Metro series. Metro 2033 is one of my favorite games ever. Despite its overall roughness, it has an atmosphere unlike any other game, and a fantastic story. Last Light is in many ways a better game than 2033. It has improved gunplay and stealth, and is a much more polished game. I wasn't a fan of the story and the characters (Khan is a completely different character, Anna is handled very poorly), but it is still a great game. I've played both of these games and their Redux versions multiple times, so I guess you can say I was looking forward to Exodus, and I'm happy to say, I'm not disappointed.Story takes place one year after Last Light and it is a sequel to the last book, Metro 2035. For reasons I won't spoil, Artyom and his wife, Anna, together with some friends, go on a journey across post-apocalyptic Russia on a train. Despite some problems, the story is overall good, but I think the real highlight of the game is the characters. I genuinely cared for all of them, I laughed and cried with them, and I did everything I can to make sure all of them made it alive to the end. There is an insane amount of optional dialogue you can listen to that helps you understand the motivations of the characters, and I applaud 4A Games for their effort.During this journey you come across mini open world levels themed after different seasons. I say 'mini open world', but that's not a bad thing. Despite spending a lot of time on the surface, it is still a linear game, but you are given the option to explore if you want. Rest assured, you won't find mindless side missions or collectibles in this game like you would in a Ubisoft game. It is still Metro. Especially that final mission. It's one of my favorite missions in the entire Metro franchise. Level design is great and the game looks gorgeous, which makes the exploration that much more fun. Not to mention, you'll find new weapon parts, ammo and crafting materials by exploring, so it is definitely encouraged. Speaking of crafting materials, let's talk about the crafting system. This game doesn't have the trade system from the previous games, instead you craft your own equipment by finding materials. You can craft medkits, filters for your gasmask, or even ammo. You also need to regularly clean your weapons, because if they get too dirty they can jam, and trust me you don't want that during combat. To clean your weapons, you need to find a workbench, but most of the crafting and weapon customization can be done on the fly. Customizing your weapons is so much fun. Just came out of a bandit camp but now you have to deal with far away mutants? You can turn your silenced revolver into a sniper rifle by slapping a long barrel, a sniper stock and a 4x scope on that bad boy. Now, let's talk about some problems. For me, the biggest problem in Metro Exodus is how clunky the movement feels. You get stuck on everyting, and climbing objects is very frustrating. Sometimes the object you are trying to climb pushes you back, and you need to repeatedly try the same climb until it finally plays the climbing animation. Another one is the hit detection on your guns. Sometimes, your bullets don't connect to enemies, like a Treyarch game. You can aim perfectly, with a fully clean gun, and the bullet will go to a random direction. This may sound like a small problem, but it can cause you to get detected during a stealth section, so it is a big problem. I once lost 10 minutes of progress on a stealth section, because my gun fired to a random object instead of the enemy in front of me, and he turned and one-shotted me on Ranger difficulty.Another big problem is the voice acting. Metro games always had bad voice acting but Exodus easily has the worst. What's even worse is, characters talk over each other. For example A and B are speaking. A is asking B a question, but B starts answering the question before A has finished asking it, so there are a few seconds in which they talk at the same time, and this happens more often then you think. Turning on the subtitles helps a little, but it is still annoying. Also, the game has many bugs and glitches, ranging from funny graphical errors to your save file getting deleted. Thankfully, 4A has patched a lot of these, but they definitely have more work to do. The final big problem is the options menu, or the lack of one. You have almost no options to customise. Can't turn off anti-aliasing or shadows, also DX12 causes many people's games to crash. There is no FOV slider, instead you have to config files to change it. Come on guys, it's 2019, please put a little more effort on your options menu.Metro Exodus is not a flawless game, but then again, no game is. I played this game for 44 hours in 4 days. I literally took a break from life and played Metro Exodus. If you are a Metro fan, play Exodus. The open world aspect of the game doesn't take away from the atmosphere. If you haven't played a Metro game before, and want to start with Exodus, you can definitely do that, I don't think you'd be confused, also the characters are mostly new. Though you should play 2033 and Last Light, I mean come on! I'd say Exodus is better than Last Light but not as good as 2033, but all three of them are must-plays!",

                "text": "It took 6 years for  to develop and publish the 3rd (and perhaps final?) instalment in the Metro series. A long time but from the below you'll see that in my opinion it was worth it. As a little background to the journey I had with Metro: Initially, I didn't think much of the first game when it was released. I certainly found it interesting but I think  made the franchise really famous and these games playable. Stealth was improved, graphics and optimisation became better and releasing the 1st game in  version was definitely an asset. One could clearly see a lot of work was put into it - it wasn't just needed for next-gen consoles like many of the remastered editions out there. Oh, by the way, I'm familiar with the first book, too, which is more like an adventure than action.Frankly, I didn't expect this. After the prologue we find ourselves in a level called  and we immediately notice the huge map we have at our disposal. Artyom is given clear instructions as to where to go but optional objectives will soon start popping up on the map. An interesting concept that increases the longevity of the game (and also encourages the speedrunners to step in and do a walkthrough as fast as possible).The  level is the next major map that puts us into a completely new environment: instead of cold we experience heat for the first time in this desert. Humanimals are the new mutants that try to disguise themselves - after a while you'll be able to notice them and avoid any surprise attacks. In case you think the outdoors makes us forget the dark, foreboding tunnels of the metro you are wrong: we'll have several opportunities to go underground so prepare yourself for welcoming those nasty spiders once again. The desert level was the first where I really started using the game's built-in photo mode. Two great things come from the sandbox approach: no more vendors i.e. ammunition as currency is not available anymore. I remember accidentally reloading my weapons with this ammo in previous instalments. Thank god the creators used a special effect for these bullets so I could quickly notice the mistake I did when shooting. With Artyom we now collect scrap metal and chemicals. We can craft ammunition and throwables - the excess we find is immediately scrapped down and get added to the quantity we have. We'll also need workbenches as some crafting can only be done there, plus, we have to repair our equipment and clean our weapons regularly. I really liked this new approach and as you can already guess things become more interesting under ranger difficulty. The weapon upgrades such as scopes or bigger magazines we scrap from enemy weapons.Finding safehouses allows Artyom to sleep. Normally, day-night cycle is around 2 hours. Approaching an outpost with several watchguards is best done under nighttime as stealth is much easier this way. Is what Artyom and the team are looking for in this game. In between missions we can spend some time on our locomotive. Have discussions with others so that we can get to know them better. Prepare for a lot of collectibles this time (not just 70 diary entries but more than a dozen postcards that are VERY hard to notice) and also don't forget the decisions you'll be able to make at key areas as once again we have two endings. There are no annoying requirements such as giving money to the poor or interacting with every single musical instrument - on my first walkthrough I managed to get the good ending by simply trying to help everyone (side objectives), sparing lives and choosing the stealth approach coupled with knocking out enemies instead of killing them.Exodus is a great sequel and continuation of Artyom's journey - now outside of Moscow. Graphics are superb, as usual, the game also has two story-oriented, no-nonsense (I'm looking at you,  and  packs) DLCs and also a  mode with lots of modifications we can choose from (24-hour day-night cycle. commentary mode, more radiation, fewer weapons etc.) the game refers to as mutations. Overall, a great package is what we have here and hats-off if you can manage to complete the game under ranger hardcore or in iron mode!",

In Exodus they evolved the game perfectly imho. It is now semi open-world and you can explore areas more less as you please.Exploring the areas is rewarding for the stuff you find and fun because everything is so detailed and looks just amazing (more on that later). In it's core this game is of course a shooter. But there are also (optional) stealth sections in the game where you silently can kill the enemies. I also liked the weapon system. Weapons feel \"heavy\" and realistic. Upgrading them was motivating and the upgrades where significant and really made the weapons better (sometimes completely changing it). Crafting system was top notch and way better than previous games, light rpg elements.The story was ok. Not very believable, especially at the end. But hey, it's a \"fantasy\" shooter anyhow. I especially liked the characters and really cared for them. Through your adventure you get to know them more and it really feels like you traveled some time with them. That was great.Graphic-wise this game just looks amazing. I literally said \"Wow\" multiple times on the most impressing areas in the game. I played it on a rtx 2060 without raytracing and it was simply beautiful.The word \"atmospheric\" describes this game for me.The two DLCs are also like how DLCs should be (imho). They are additional to the main game and detail a story branch of the main game (The Two Colonels) which has amazing writing and (Sam's Story) which continues the story of a side-character from the main game. They both provide brand new areas and weapons. You don't have to play them, but if you liked the main game, I advice you - go ahead and play all of them! 9/10",

                "text": "Hey! (Sorry for my bad english)Despite having its flaws, it sure is one of - if not the best - hub world fps games of 2019/2020. Even if you liked the previous 'Metro Games\" there is still a chance you won't like this one due to changes to its core formula. Better watch some gameplay footage and decide for yourself. Playing with a RTX 2070 Super + I7-9700KF @ 3.60 GHz:- Constantly crashing while having RTX enabled (just disable that unoptimized pile of a s*** and scale up the shading rate)- NPC's having a 'wallhack' on higher difficulties (I already hate myself for trying to take the stealthy approach)- Getting stuck even between the smallest rock while walking/running- Too much drowning early on (me just being clumsy I guess)- NG+ is still pretty much buggy (gonna shift that to + as soon as the developers fix it properly)+/- Graphically demanding (even on a high-end rig)+/- Dialogue conversations between NPC's can be very long yet interesting (and tedious if u intend on listening to all of them)+/- Synchronization (some people like it and some don't. Personally, I'm really enjoying the english dub)+ Graphically one of the best looking games + Storytelling (as always with Metro)+ Interesting characters (as always with Metro)+ Character models+ NPC's responding dynamically to your actions+ World rich in variety (somewhat open - still a hub world)+ Being able to accomplish your goals by playing stealthy and/or kill everyone as you please (there are certain parts where you're forced to shoot yourself through)+ Weather system+ Gunplay+ Weapon customization/Looting System (not as depth as die-hard-rpg-fans would like, still satisfying)If you hate and/or like my review, please let me know. Open for feedback and different opinions. Good evening.",

                "text": "A masterpiece of a game, I know this word is overused a lot, but truly one of the most immersive games Ive ever played, you don't play through metro exodus, you live through it. A wonderfully crafted story that will take you through different parts of russia, different climates, different times of year and weather, as you encounter all sorts of different crazy characters, lots of baddies but also some truly good ones, it feels like a journey of a lifetime and for most if not all the characters on board your train - it is. The game centers around your exodus from snowy nuclear winter moscow into the wilderness of the rest of russia, as you travel across it on a train fittingly named Aurora, the goddess of dawn. Each member of your crew feels like a real human being and they are all very talkative, happy to share with you their thoughts and feelings over a smoke break or a cup of questionable beverage, despite your character being mostly a mute (only ever talking during loading screens) the game plays with it pretty well. Sadly I can not tell you more about the story, because its a thing thats best enjoyed yourself without any spoilers or tips.Now, why did I say it was immersive and you live through it, well simply put, its because it lets you become the main protagonist, it never breaks character and you feel as you are part of the story, you are not just a player, you are Artyom, there are no cutscenes, instead there are moments when you lose control of your character, but its all always done in first person, you shake hands, you hug characters, you give toys to children or items to your crew members, all done in first person. You get attacked by mutants and have to free yourself in first person with a quicktime event (which has several accesibility options so you dont have to mash a button like a crazy person), you row boats and drive vehicles, you push buttons and pull levers, open or close doors, but all with a proper animation, you have to recharge your flashlight manually with a portable charger, put your gas mask on and off, put the nightvision googles on, wipe the dirt off your mask, fix it up quickly, burn some spider webs with your lighter which can cause some spiders to crawl all over your hands and face and so much more that I am probably forgetting, but you get the idea. There is only really one menu of sorts and thats the crafting one, still the game tries its best to make even that feel realistic and part of the world too.Now, all the immersion aside, what about the gameplay itself you might ask? Well its simply fun and allows for different style of play and approach, several different difficulty settings allow for any kind of player, from a casual to hardcore, from story enjoyer to immersion freak, you can set it all up yourself. You get to fight all sorts of different beasts but also humans. Speaking of humans, there are basicly always 2 options for you, stealth or combat and you always have the choice which one you pick. Combat is only forced in one single chapter/mission but i would argue you are not truly fighting humans at that point but rather beasts in human form, play it and see for yourself :) Stealth however is never forced on you. So you might be wondering, why would you ever want to stealth then? Well aside enjoying stealth itself you might wanna do it because of the karma system in this game, same as previous games, the ending of your game will depend on how much of a humanist you were during your playthrough. See, while there are factions in this game that are truly evil and they know it, those you are allowed to kill as much as you want, bandits, raiders, slave owners, you know, that kind, there are several factions that are not evil and are just defending themselves from you, the intruder into their world, with those, you might wanna rethink your approach and maybe try to stealth and spare them, speaking of sparing people, even the bad guys sometimes will surrender, as a rule of thumb the last survivor of a group of bandits prefers to surrender than die like the rest of his gang, at that point killing them would also give you bad karma. The karma system does not just end the game differently, it changes the way other characters react to your actions and interract with you, it changes the endings of several chapters of the game before the game end itself, all in all, as you might realise now, it calls for at least 2 playthroughs, oh and there is also new game +.As far as DLC goes, both are great even if they play out fairly differently. The Two Colonels is a more linear one of the two, jumping between 2 different time periods and 2 different characters, hence the name, it tells a great story of the struggle of one colonel between his duty as a soldier and his obligations as a parent of a young child, a great story all in all, even if a sad one at that. Sam's Story is a bit more open one, like the base game, and takes place after the end of Metro Exodus main story, Sam, the only american in your russian crew takes on a long journey in his attempt to leave russia and finally come home to his parents that may or may not still be living in whats left of usa. Not only is Sam an interesting character in both the base game and the dlc (being an american in post nuclear war russia aint easy) but he is also voiced by the legendary Steve Blum, that you might know from Cowboy Bebop as the voice of Spike Spiegel. I forgot to mention, both him and the colonel from the other DLC are not mutes at all, since you are no longer Artyom, they talk and they talk a lot, both in-game and during loading screens, so prepare to hear lots from them during gameplay.This review is getting kinda long, so ill try to wrap it up for you here. The graphics are great but also demanding, especially so the enchanced edition that you get for free for owning the base game, so do check the requirements and how well it performs online. The audio design is absolutely awesome, the music gives that extra atmosphere to the setting, be it during combat or calmer moments and overall the sound is solid, the weapons and monsters especially so, the guns feel powerful, loud and real and the mutants feel scary, strong and sometimes plain disgusting. (like giant spiders or worms, definently do NOT buy if you have arachnophobia). There are however occasional bugs,  I did not encounter anything game breaking, but I did see an occasional t-pose of an enemy i already killed or like when the combat music got stuck for me once and kept playing despite me being out of any combat and then just randomly fixed itself later, one enemy once phased through several tables and a window to get to me which gave me a light scare, the bugs are rare but they do exist, its nowhere near cyberpunk or fallout but its not 100% perfect either, so i felt i need to address it. Does it ruin the game? No, absolutely not and it gets my recommendation, It is a 10/10 game for me, that left me amazed and only wishing for more and a sequel. Speaking of sequels, Metro Exodus is a sequel, so I highly advice you get Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light, since its all one connected story, I would argue Exodus is a bit more independent from the previous games, still, you will not understand a lot of plotpoints if you have not played the previous ones and those games are masterpieces too, so get the whole trilogy when you get the chance. I came to play as Artyom for the third time, but instead I lived as him from start to finish, a wonderfully crafted story-driven adventure, that shows how do to both storytelling and immersion into the gameworld right, It grabs you and does not let you go till you are done, a rare but true 10/10, get it and you wont regret the money and time spent :)",

                "text": "Hands down my favorite game in the Metro Series. There is less of mystical stuff. Game is generally focused on post-apocalyptic survival and exploration. I consider Metro Exodus a fully fledged AAA first person story game. That's a mouthful, but it is a great leap forward for the series as a whole. Previous two  titles were AA quality, but still awesome. Metro Exodus is excellent.So what does make Metro Exodus stand out? It is a newer game with gorgeous graphics, well-crafted and adequately paced story, which are all mixed with horror/stealth/action gameplay. You can go Rambo if you want too. I'm obviously touching the tip of an iceberg here. If you are into Fallout or Mad Max games, you should definitely give Metro Exodus a try. The previous two games were strictly linear, whereas Exodus spiced things up with open-world levels. All of main story and side quests will affect the ending of the game. Thus, you might actually play the game twice to get the ending you think fits better.As in previous games, you make moral choices. This time around you have well-designed side characters, who will be affected by the choices you make. After completing a level, you might catch yourself listening to side character dialogues for additional information. The world around you feels alive, and your allies are there to share their opinion on your actions too. For example, I made a call to follow a side character's advice, they brought it up in their smoking break chat like 5 hours later in the game. Your allies also get stuff done and save your ass out of trouble, so it does not feel like a Fallout 4 settlement, where you have to change everyone's diapers and get everything done by yourself.I don't want to give away anything important about the game's story, but it is great. Sometimes it is difficult to keep the fans excited, but I was seriously impressed that there was so much more beyond the lore of the previous two games in the series. Metro Exodus took everything I liked about the original two games, and just expanded upon them. I like how there is a good mix of linear and open world levels. This is how single player games should be made. You manage your ammo, weapons, loot either on a go or at a work bench. Looting in complete darkness with spiders behind you is something. The campaign is much longer and might feel tiresome. Use the quick save to take breaks from the game. It took me 40 hours to finish the game thoroughly and Rambo combat, whereas stealth style was only 20 hours. In my second playthrough I did my best to get certain things done in the story,  and it paid off with new cut scenes and noticeable gratitude from side characters. The campaign is great, really.Graphics. Well wow! I played the game with Extreme graphics and Ultra RTX. Well I can't go back to regular graphics after that. RTX Global Illumination makes the lighting and shadows look too real. Every corner, passage, or a room are properly lit up resulting in an extreme immersion especially in dark spooky areas. I beat the game twice, once without RTX and once with RTX on. I caught myself using the night vision goggles in the areas that weren't even dark without RTX. I get it that vast  majority of players haven't experienced the game with RTX, but it is still worth pointing out. Metro Exodus looks great either way, but it really feels next gen with RTX maxed out.The game is buggy. I have previously lost about 15 hours of gameplay. I was mad; thus it took me about 6 months to get back to the game. It is especially frustrating that nearly two years since the game's launch, it hasn't been properly patched yet. There are still levels with shaky frame rate. Vaulting was finally added to the game, but it is not perfect either. Sometimes I can't initiate it. In retrospect, I can't even imagine what the early days of the game were like. Glitches galore probably.Considering PC specs and experience with the bugs, opinions may vary. I did not even mention the last minute dump  to another launcher prior to the game's launch.  Metro Exodus is an excellent game with noticeable improvements from previous games. It is a buggy AAA attempt from a AA studio. However, the main story is so great that I will give this game the benefit of the doubt. It is a must play for the fans of a single player genre.Edit: this is my GOTY on Steam!",

                "text": "Metro Exodus is hands down the crowning achievement of the Metro franchise. It brings Artyom and company out of the claustrophobic metro tunnels of 2033 & Last Light, and into the daylight of POST-apocalyptic Russia, in all its glory. Never before has a game so effectively blended the polish of a linear FPS with the freedom of a reactive open world, while capturing a Slavic atmosphere which rivals that of blin-kingpin S.T.A.L.K.E.R. itself. Exodus takes Metro to fantastic new heights while cutting out nearly all the lows, whether that be in gameplay, world-building, or storytelling. As a fan of the series for years, I\u2019m happy to report that this  the sequel we were waiting for.Metro Exodus begins with the protagonist, Artyom, plagued by the suspicion that there is still human life left on the surface beyond the Moscow Metro system. You, as Artyom, have been making frequent dangerous excursions to the surface since the end of the previous game in the hopes of finding a radio signal to validate this theory. This causes strife with your wife, Anna, who is fearful that one day you won\u2019t arrive home still breathing. As a consequence, she decides to come with you on one of your trips to the surface to watch your back. On that fateful day, Artyom and Anna discover; not a radio signal, but actual people who claim to hail from outside the city\u2026 as well as an operational locomotive train, capable of taking them \u2013 and the Spartan Order \u2013 across the country.Shifting to the graphics of Exodus, I have to say that they are entirely up to series standards. The art style is identical to that of its redux-ed predecessors, but every visual detail has been tweaked to breathtaking fidelity. Textures are photorealistic, faces are way beyond the uncanny valley in a positive direction, animations are fluid and numerous, the lighting is gorgeous to the point that its beauty exceeds real life, and all other technical components are practically flawless. The soundscape is noticeably (mostly) unchanged from the previous games, however there is a whole new soundtrack which accompanies Exodus\u2019s atmosphere terrifically. As for performance, the game is demanding, but still well optimized. All in all, I\u2019m absolutely taken by Metro Exodus\u2019s presentation.Exodus is divided into roughly three separate maps throughout the course of the game, as well as a few more linear levels. While the settings themselves are gorgeous to the eye, from the swamps of the Volga River to the deserts of the dried up Caspian Sea, there\u2019s also a lot to do. Each region has multiple objectives and locations, with secrets to uncover and loot to seize. There is a disparate theme to the individual provinces too, giving Exodus a real sense of variety. Notes and audio journals dot the world-space as well, revealing the history of a place and its people following the war. The several environmental stories told are enlightening, and sometimes even heart-rending. Altogether, Exodus\u2019s environments are impeccably designed, and reward intense investigation.Metro Exodus, among other secondary features, utilizes an all new crafting and modification system, which I\u2019d say is\u2026 a mixed bag. The crafting component of the game feels lazy, as there are only two materials to work with: metals and chemicals, which (annoyingly) functionally constitute 90% of the games lootable items \u2013 meaning most valuable consumables must be crafted. On the modification side of things, there\u2019s a lot more to like. There are roughly ten base guns in the game, but each can be radically altered to work more effectively in different scenarios. Gear modification serves as the progression system, so it\u2019s important to stay up-to-date with your weapons and accessories. There are a few more gameplay mechanics such as stealth, radiation, and vehicles, but all can be roughly summarized as \u2018well implemented.\u2019The Metro series is known for its atmosphere, and the immersion of its combat is a central element. I truly believe Metro Exodus has perfected the first-person impact of firing a gun; between the recoil and sound design, and even on down to the stopping power of each individual weapon. And good news \u2013 from bandits to mutant beasts, and slavers to the eerie humanimals, there\u2019s a whole host of new adversaries to blast away across the scarred face of Russia. The AI of human enemies is quite sophisticated too, being able to call out your position to their allies if they spot you; relative to the objects around you. It\u2019s also worth noting that you can defeat humans non-lethally, and that combatants will surrender if routed. Intricacies like these nested within Exodus\u2019 combat system are what drive the gameplay, and make it uniquely satisfying.Refocusing on Exodus\u2019s story, it\u2019s a much better tale than that of the previous titles. For reasons I won\u2019t spoil; you, Anna, Colonel Miller, and the rest of the Spartan Order travel eastward through post-apocalyptic Russia in the train found at the beginning of the game, which is quickly coined the . As the crew trek across the scorched earth of the motherland, seasons change, and new societies are discovered. The survivors of the nuclear holocaust have become vicious luddites, bandits, cannibals, and slavers \u2013 but a rare few have preserved their humanity. Eventually the Order\u2019s goal becomes to find an untainted land to call home; a place where a civilized society can rebuild, and Artyom and Anna can raise a family.Whereas in past Metro games the supporting characters were side-pieces or even something of a nuisance, Exodus is much more character-driven in its storytelling. The blank stares of Bourbon and Khan are gone; replaced by the sensitive compassion of Stepan, cockiness of the impressionable Duke, and the  love of Artyom\u2019s wife, Anna. The Aurora\u2019s crew grows and changes with time, developing through the experiences they endure and the trials they overcome. If you care to bend an ear, your comrades will talk it off, expressing their thoughts, plans, hopes, and fears. While the translation of dialogue to English can be clunky at times, the character writing itself is just magnificent. The inspiring humanity of this small group of characters truly bring your goals as Artyom into perspective. The people of Metro Exodus are what make the whole experience.On a quick narrative note before my final verdict, I\u2019d like to clearly express that Exodus tracks your moral status throughout the course of the 25-odd hour campaign. There are particular actions you can complete that will give you positive karma, and specific crimes you can commit that will accrue negative karma. How you interact with the game world and its characters will have consequences \u2013 not only in the form of separate endings, but in a cascade of different narrative outcomes. The Order\u2019s exodus is a treacherous one, but the most perilous war is that of the one which rages .I feel my opinion on this game has been made fairly obvious by this point, but that doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t praise it further. Metro Exodus is one of the best games, period, that I have ever played. Its the culmination of what already was a phenomenal series, and Exodus pulls no punches in giving the trilogy a stupendously vast, enjoyable, meticulous, touching, and downright impressive send-off. I couldn\u2019t have imagined a better way to conclude Artyom\u2019s journey.",

                "text": "Excellent game. Won't blow your socks off, but literally brings fresh air into Metro series by introducing open world outdoor areas mixed with those claustrophobic indoors we've come to expect.You manage to escape Moscow and are now on train, searching for a refuge to settle in. That's basic plot.THE GOOD:+ Graphics. Soviet apocalypse has never looked better.+ Lengthy and immersive.+ Lot's of dialogue and interaction with friendly npc's, almost to the point of exhaustion. You    get to know them and their mindset fairly well. Between missions, you can spend 30min to    1hour inside the train, just listening their ramblings.+ Level variety. From metro tunnel settlements to frozen Volga to underground bunkers to    Caspian deserts to lush forests to new irradiated cities. There's a lot to see and ground to    explore. And exploration is rewarded well.+ More emphasis on stealth than before... BUT...+ Surprisingly stable. Has yet to crash even once for me.+ Excellent DLC's. The Two Colonels is a short one, but brings a light to the tragedy of    another Metro community we come across in the main game. And you get to play with a    flamethrower quite a bit. Sam's Story is a longer one and let's just say it tingled my    S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-senses, like, a lot. I'll leave it to that :)THE NEUTRAL:+ / - The story. Not bad nor super excellent. Pretty much what you expect from Metro games         in general: does the job with few nuances and that's it.+ / - Weapon and suit upgrade system is pretty basic but I'm glad it's there, because the high        end upgrades are awesome. THE BAD:- There's more stealth emphasis, yes, but the system is iffy. Sometimes enemies feel totally    blind but sometimes spot you no matter what you do. Too much trial and error in my book.- Weapon selection is still pretty much the same as in previous games. Only a few new ones. I   know that the Metro's world setting limits weapon selection, but c'mon. Where are all the   PKM's, SVD's, RPG-7's, civilian owned Mosin-Nagants, Tokarev pistols, different AK-variants   or underbarrel granade launchers? You'd think at least Stalkers would have found a few from   military depots... or locals would've turned those into something Metro-made.- Plenty of npc dialogue, but mostly it doesn't lead anywhere. No new mission objectives,   revelations or anything. Just the mundane stuff. And Artyom still doesn't reply or comment   anything. A simple commenting choice \u00e1 la Titanfall 2 would've spiced things up a notch.- The main story has a pretty big revelation about the current world situation in the first hours   of the game, but sadly this isn't expanded upon later in the game. I think the game would   benefit from tidbits of information about what events lead to the apocalypse and how the   current world is beyond Russia.__________________________________________________________________________All in all? If you liked previous Metro-games, this is a no-brainer (dlc's included). If you're new to the series: story wise, I recommend you play the first two redux installments first. With every installment, the Metro series has gotten progressively better. Definitely looking forward to the next one!And Epic Store can seriously f*ck off.",

Yes, I know I'm a bit late to the party, but seriously - \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 EGS and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Tim Sweeney in particular for having the gall to continuously come out and spew loads of \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, pretending to be some misunderstood genius and a visionaire, claiming that he's acting purely in interests of gamers, while in reality it all comes down to greed and greed alone. And also shame on 4A/Deep Silver/whomever is responsible for this \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 decision. Shame on them for being among the first who set this train (no pun intended) in motion.Now when that's out of the way, let's get to the actual review:Metro Exodus is a game that was a bit rushed, just like many other games. It gets pretty obvious in the last two chapters and one can feel it in many aspects throughout the game, but it still manages to deliver. It provides experience that is somewhat different from previous games in the series, but it doesn't step away from it's core formula too much to alienate its core fanbase, at least in my opinion. I would also like to add that there's hardly anything left to be told about life in metro, so the devs made the right call when they decided to lead our characters on the surface and out of Moscow. Overall, the gameplay is okay (although they should really hire somebody with experience in designing FPS games), the story is pretty decent and all it's shortcomings are compensated with some really wholesome moments that you can spend with other characters. The graphics are nice, but the game is rather hardware-demanding and the sound design is, like always, superb.8/10. A game definitely worth buying for the series' fans, and actually a decent entry place for newcomers; although I would definitely recommend playing the games in their right order, if you wish to give it a try.",

                "text": "In light of all the upset currently surrounding Metro Exodus I wanted to provide my own, more middle of the road review. Everything I say here comes from someone who, while enjoying the Metro games, is by no means an overly supportive fan who would instantly love anything with the Metro name slapped on it. Nor am I willing to pretend I hate a game simply because others have decided it must be hated no matter what.As it has been the subject of many debates already I am going to avoid beating a dead horse here and refrain from giving too much discussion over the decision to remove the game from Steam in favor of exclusivity on the Epic store. All I will say about this is that I find it to be a very underhanded move, but my frustration lies with Epic and Deep Silver\u2019s corporate team, who are ultimately the ones who made this decision. I find the hate aimed towards the devs of Metro, who typically have no say in such decisions, to be misguided. Especially when they have obviously poured a lot of love into a game that has had its launch marred by a decision that was out of their control. I happened to preorder Exodus just about a week before the removal from Steam was announced, but in the interest of full disclosure I will admit that had I not happened to catch it at this time I would be waiting a year for it to be back on Steam so as not to support the Epic store.First and foremost Exodus absolutely blew me away with the level design. You will find there to be a much greater variation in locations and scenery than ever before seen in a Metro game. Every single area you encounter is completely breathtaking in its own unique way, with an incredible amount of detail on just about everything. For a game that is meant to be played through slowly and deliberately this beautiful world-building absolutely pays off, as you find yourself really wanting to explore and take it all in. The world does manage to feel a lot more open than we might be used to with Metro, providing a lot more space for you to explore and figure out a stealthy approach into various situations. But this being said, the game is still very linear, as you are never wandering around aimlessly and still have various objectives which keep you moving straight from one area to the next. This feeling of having a bit more space and freedom provides a nice contrast to all of the time you will spend exploring dark, claustrophobia-inducing underground areas.I absolutely adore the characters, especially Anna, your ass-kicking wife. The game does such a good job at truly making you feel the love between her and Artyom, with their interactions coming off as being very honest and sincere. The story is very interesting and unique, and I found myself to be genuinely interested in seeing what would happen next. There are a number of lengthy cutscenes, which I found to be well-done and important to the story, but I feel it is worth mentioning as I know this is not for everyone. You will have chances to return to the train which is carrying you and your crew, a feature I greatly enjoyed. I really loved taking these opportunities to explore how the train had grown and changed, as well as interacting with the other passengers. This really helped give a feeling of realism to the characters, making you care about them and their fate.Overall I really enjoyed my time playing Metro Exodus, but there are a few glaring issues that need to be addressed. First and foremost, the optimization is absolutely terrible. Instead of being offered the ability to individually mess with each setting you are forced to pick from presets: Low, Medium, High, Ultra, and Extreme. This essentially forces you to pick whatever setting your rig can best handle, which means you will most likely be forced into a setting that is actually below the capability of your PC, simply because the next preset enables just one setting that is just slightly too much for your setup. Had there been more customization offered with graphics settings this could have been easily avoided.Another issue I had with Exodus are the completely random obstacles and/or invisible walls that I would run into and get stuck on. On quite a few occasions when exploring (or even worse, during a fight) I\u2019d find myself randomly unable to walk over an area that looked as if you should be able to walk through it. While I love and appreciate the huge amount of detail in this game, it\u2019s very frustrating to lose a fight simply because you found yourself caught on a twig.I also encountered a few bugs, mostly entertaining (like trying to leave my cabin on the train only to find myself soaring high above the map). But there were a few bugs that messed with my gameplay, most notably being an enemy that was somehow able to stick their gun through the wall to shoot at me. Exodus is a wonderful game that will greatly benefit from some patching. Had its release not been cast in a bad light due to a questionable business move then I feel it would be highly beloved right now. But those who are forced to wait until its return to Steam next year might actually find that this worked in their favor, as it will provide time for some final kinks to be worked out so that they may enjoy a great game the way it was meant to be played",

I was not expecting to enjoy so much that I would play it completely through 3 times and do several stages over after that to get all the achievements (Finding all the notes and postcards is very time consuming). It's a linear game, but each stage is very open for you to complete how you want. If you're a fan of the Metro series I am pretty sure you are going to like this one. The characters and story are very well done, and I recommend listening to all the conversations and doing all the side missions at least once to get the whole feel of the game because it's possible to rush through the game in under 18 hours but you are cheating yourself if you do it that quick.It's sad that the publisher decided to remove the game from Steam and make it an Epic Store exclusive for the first year after all the free advertising they got out of it on Steam, but I can't give this game a negative review because of that because the developers of the game put a lot of love and effort into this gem. Best game of 2019 so far, and it will be hard to beat for the year I think. If you are waiting for it to return to Steam next year I highly recommend you buy and play it as soon as it's available.",

This game is the one that keeps you playing and playing because you want to know whats gonna happen next, and this is so damn good. Keep in mind that you and Anna are married now, so you have to take good care of her, and don't forget to protect u crew. Play at ranger hardcore for better experience, be a nice guy and go for the good ending. This game is perfect. Would bang 10/10.",

I have nothing but praise for this game, especially in the story aspects. I've seen the Metro series before on Steam, just browsing, but I dismissed it for whatever reason. At the time of writing this, I've only played Exodus, but if this one game is anything to go by, I wish I hadn't dismissed it so quickly. It's... I've gone speechless again. It's amazing. The chapters each have good and bad endings, another thing I didn't expect, and it made the game feel...surreal, the way it judges you, if that makes sense. The characters feel... like family. Like you have to protect them, even if it means putting your life and your beautiful,Russian-man body on the line. There's moral dilemmas that I didn't realize I made a bad decision on until it was way, way too late. ().The gunplay is phenomenal. It feels... not realistic, that's impossible for a video game, in my opinion... It feels way more realistic than anything I've ever played, though. The way the guns are loud, a sharp crack in the silence, it's incredibly immersing. There are several guns, but I'll focus on the AK (Or Kalash/Kalashnikov, as it's called in this game). I haven't shot an AK, I've shot everything from pellet guns to AR's, but the way Artyom fires his AK is exactly what I expect it to be. A loud, sudden, sharp crack, followed by either a pained scream from the person or animal you just royally pissed off, or the deafening silence from whatever is on the recieving end of that barrel. Guns get dirty, and jam, too. It makes sense, to an extent, but it bothered me a little that Artyom could wipe blood or spider-goop off his visor easily in one swift *wipe*, but dusting that little bit of mud off the gun with his sleeve, his glove, or even a rag he may keep in his backpack? Heavens no, comrade. That's too nasty, even for big, strong, Vodka-loving Russian man.Stealth matters too. It can change the ending of the game. I usually stealth through everything, until I get shot at, then I fire back. It's not boring stealth though. There's elements like light exposure, your position, enemy lines of sight, sound, all making it very engaging in practice. The enemy AI isn't completely retarded either. It can pass as realistic.Easy 94/100. I cannot praise this game enough. There were only a few minor details, like the previously mentioned gun cleaning, that annoyed me in any way, shape, or form. I got it for $15.99 on sale on a whim because I was bored, and I found myself lying awake late last night, 7 hours into the story, thinking \"I want to keep playing Exodus, but I need to go to bed already.\"",

This game is not just about killing people though as it encourages you to consider the consequences of your actions. No matter how you choose to play, everything is designed to perfection and works great. Metro Exodus is actually about protecting people and only killing those who are really asking for it. After a couple of playthroughs, I started to notice more of the attention to detail, especially with the characters in my crew. This game does a fantastic job of providing immersion for many different approaches to completing the campaign. I realised that I would need to protect and represent my crew if I was going to succeed in my mission by getting the good ending. If you act like a bastard and kill everything that moves you will only be experiencing part of what this game has to offer. This is definitely a game worth putting in the time to complete 100% achievements. As it is rich with depth and detail, some of which can be easily missed if you don\u2019t play through the campaign more than once.The developers at 4A Games are taking things to the next level of entertainment and technology with Metro Exodus. They are extremely talented and have created a more than suitable third entry in the already amazing Metro series.The previous games in this series had been enjoyed here on Steam by many players for a few years before this release. The series has in fact been considered one of the best franchises on the platform.It is such a shame that this game above all was chosen for an exclusivity deal and removed from Steam. I would like to think that because this series is so loved and because this is such a great game.PC gamers will never forget this crap and that the Epic Games Store will disappear in the near future. As they have generated so much bad publicity for their platform that it has become ridiculous at this point.Steam have been praised for substantially reducing the piracy of games like this one on PC. With Gaben himself quoted as saying \u2018piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem\u2019. The Epic Games store\u2019s exclusivity deals and lack of service features encourage piracy on PC. They seem to be underestimating the leverage that PC gamers have over providers.Anyway besides all the unfortunate crap with greedy, corporate pigs on the business side of things. Metro Exodus is a fantastic entry into the Metro series and a step forward for the design of this type of game in general.It\u2019s release may be unfortunately messed up but the game itself is in top shape. I would recommend that at this point you pirate the game. Then when it becomes available again here on Steam show your support and buy it.Please do not be fooled by the Epic Games store, they should be boycotted until they disappear. I hope to see them fail in the near future for the good of PC games in general.",

                "text": "I played this excellent game not too long after release, and really loved every minute of it. Metro Exodus takes everything that was great about Last Light (which took everything that was great about 2033) and made it even better by opening up the world and sending you on a pretty  adventure lol. The story of Metro Exodus is most decidedly one of hope. While I'm sure you can get a less than good feeling ending, I think I got pretty much the best one in my estimation. It really left me wanting more Metro, but also gave me the sense that the world was about to start changing for the better.I'd also note that the writers did an excellent job of humanizing pretty much every character in the game. Even the least human of them lol. Everyone had motivations that made sense, and your merry band of train dwellers were especially easy to grow attached to.Speaking of trains, you probably already know the gist of the story. Seeing the end of the Metro system is clearly in sight, Artyom and crew embark upon a journey to see if there are any habitable places left in the land above. The journey really ends up being a captivating ride across the Russian post apocalypse, with memorable quests and some nice story twists. Plus, how you interact with the story will directly impact the outcome of your playthrough.Honestly, the gameplay was consistent with Last Light, if refined a bit. They abridged the currency system. Crafting also has seen a nice upgrade. The weapons are of course very customizable and the specifics will be largely dependent on how you choose to play this or the needs of the moment.While the classic claustrophobic Metro gameplay is still there, it isn't as pervasive, and of course, as I'm sure you know, a lot of the game is spent aboveground (although missions still tend to end up underground in creepy as hell locations). Some of the classic enemies make their notorious return in Exodus, but there are also new enemies to reflect the new circumstances. One minor gripe: the developers do love those light hating spiders, but me personally, I find them annoying.Anyway, the game is also a limited open world, with a few different regions and terrains. There are also people living above ground, and in fact, many of them never had a chance to get to a Metro system to avoid the nuclear apocalypse. Overall, with the notable exception of this being more of an open world game, I think fans of the series will find a lot they are already familiar with, but with some nice upgrades.Yeah, these are the type of graphics that never cease to impress. Seriously, the game is pretty stunning in every way. Set pieces, character animations...this game has it all. It will also definitely let you know where your rig stands lol. Personally, I played using a 1050ti on Medium to High settings, and it definitely struggled at times (typically when there were a LOT of enemies on screen at one time), but outside of those moments, the game handled fine in my estimation. The game crashed four times during my playthrough, which, given how much this game can stress a system, seemed like a mild victory lol.Yeah. This game definitely features some unforgettable scenes, graphics, and artwork. Also, the cutscenes were top tier. Truly evocative and imaginative imagery.Again, this game really utilizes everything available, from excellent ambient sounds to the sounds of interaction and combat, to the actual conversations. Everything was particularly well done, and that voice acting? I think all the actors should feel proud of their work here. Not only were they on point, but they really convey emotion, and a wide range of such. This game runs the gamut of emotion, and the actors did a spectacular job of recognizing, honoring, and then actually pulling it off in such a way as to really make you care about each and every character.Oh..and that soundtrack. So diverse and emotional! Excellence bar none. Enjoy!For me, the Metro series is and will continue to be one of my all time favorites, and Exodus only served to strengthen my love for it. This is one hell of a game, with a ton of replay value, so many feels, and excellent gripping gameplay.  It is however also worth noting that you don't necessarily need to have played the previous games to both enjoy and understand this one. They do a great job of filling in the blanks, in my opinion.",

                "text": "Metro games are made with passion. The series expounds on what was previously derived from the novel  by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, that was later produced into a movie, , by Andrei Tarkovsky, that inspired the Metro book series, before it finally making its way into video games. Metro Exodus is the third entry in this series. And it might be the greatest.Whether it checks that box for the consumer depends on if returning players, or newcomers, can handle the holistic changes that come packaged within Exodus. It\u2019s a different game from its progenitors. It provides fundamental Metro gameplay, but it is now expanded within the context of open-sandbox environments. Which is a stark contrast from the on-the-rails story beats returning players might expect. Metro Exodus elected to give the player the power to create their own set pieces. And it was a risk, but a calculated one.The creators were most certainly attempting to broaden their consumer base while also being mindful of those returning (although Epic Store\u2013timed exclusivity kind of screwed that up anyway). But alterations from the norm were a success. Metro Exodus is fantastic.  In the wake of apocalyptic nuclear war, the Metro series follows the surviving inhabitants living in the old Moscow Metro, or subway system. Metro stations have become towns and the remaining populace has formed collectivist ownership over these towns. Over time, each station established its own unique identity. Some friendly, some not. Previous Metro titles (Metro 2033 and Metro: Last Light) tasked the player with navigating the metro, warring with self-radicalized stations, and dealing with irradiated monsters that now stalk the tunnels.Exodus is about Artyom, the series\u2019s protagonist, leaving Moscow with a squad of series regulars on a year-long journey across Russia. The game opens remarkably similar to previous entries. The player traverses a frozen Moscow landscape, journeys through a metro station, and is otherwise exposed to linear narrative threads. None of this is tedious though. The Metro series has already showcased how adept it is at handling linearity. Mostly, it does it through atmosphere and mood, which continues to be exhibited in Exodus. Artyom has always been a silent protagonist, the exception being his journal entries that are voiced during loading screens. Exodus keeps the same format, and in doing so, handles expository information well. It is difficult to competently and realistically disseminate exposition in a meaningful way with a mute character, so it\u2019s amazing how effortlessly Exodus does it. The player naturally learns of the events that happened between Last Light and this current story, the most important of which is that Artyom\u2019s lover, Anna, remains as such.Events take place that cause Artyom and his crew to leave Moscow for the Russian countryside via locomotive. After that, familiar linearity of old metro systems is mostly abandoned in favor of successive, unique sandboxes that change as each chapter progresses. And they\u2019re all astounding.After leaving Moscow, the story proceeds through four unique chapters that all feature different playscapes. Mostly these areas offer aesthetic differences that revolve around the seasons in which your crew visits them. Basically, expect the summer area to feel hotter and the autumn area to feel colder. The first three sandboxes, in particular, elect to give up control to the player to create their own action within the various locations constructed. It is obviously an enormous risk to create a Metro game that doesn\u2019t take place in, well, a metro. But they had reason to bet on themselves.The creators were able to split the difference between their typical, linear narrative structure and popular open-world exploration. This was achieved by not making any one area have  much to do or be  big to explore. Artyom has a map of each region, and that map is highlighted with areas of importance. Some of these highlights feature a monster\u2019s nest to destroy or a bandit\u2019s camp to clear, while others contain pertinent story points.  It really works.  Exodus swapped tunnels for open landscapes featuring a day-and-night cycle. The same emotions that the player previously felt exploring the darkness of the metro is again achieved through this approach. It is still extremely immersive, and surprisingly eerie, to traverse Exodus\u2019s landscapes in intense darkness, surrounded by things that want to kill you. The environments are different. The atmosphere is the same.An absolute must when developing sandboxes is that there exists an inherent mechanical reason for the player to explore them, in addition to narrative motivations. If not, the game is just as on-the-rails as before, only now watered down with unnecessary fluff. Fortunately, Exodus does provide a reason. Not only do the environments look interesting, they usually contain important crafting materials within. These resources are used to upgrade, modify, and clean Artyom\u2019s equipment. And equipment can degrade rapidly depending on the situation. Which means nearly every collapsed building, dark tunnel, or campfire in the distance is worth checking out. Occasionally Artyom will run into members of his own squad while exploring these ruins, which adds to player immersion. The world just feels alive.Exodus tells a wonderful story. It features terrific characters, some of which were introduced in the previous games, and expands on their personas. There is, admittedly, a trope-ish element that exists here somewhat\u2014there are tough characters, funny characters, and sweet characters. But if the player spends enough time listening to their conversations, they will eventually observe personalities that exist beyond their archetypes. Especially with Anna. Anna engenders immense pathos by the story\u2019s conclusion, partly because the player is granted so many different, immersive ways to interact with her. All of which are extraordinarily additive. Maybe you\u2019ll put your arm around her, or hold her hand, or brush her hair back. And while all of this is completely optional, it is hard to imagine any Metro player electing not to. Their relationship feels honest. Which is doubly an achievement when you consider that Artyom never utters a word. When certain circumstances arise that place Anna in extreme danger, there is an emergent need for the player to deliver her safely and as quickly as possible. By the time Exodus\u2019s train reaches its final destination, the player will have experienced one of the more immersive stories in recent years. A story that, much to its credit, features multiple endings to increase replayability. I have beaten the game twice (once on console), and both endings were different, excellent finales. One of the endings was the  ending. But it didn\u2019t seem bad to me; more like good storytelling.Metro Exodus is the third part in the Metro series. It is a mechanically sound, first-person shooter that takes place across a litany of areas that the player will explore. It is a blast to play. It contains a strong story that perfectly balances gameplay with narrative beats. While it may lack some of the spectacle seen in more well-known franchises, it more than makes up for it in its polish and atmosphere. In fact, Metro Exodus surpasses nearly all of its contemporaries with relative ease.",

                "text": "Fantastic Game, i personally felt the chapterwise divison and inclusion of a few open world levels in between linear levels really made the gameplay shockingly refresing, especially since almost no area overstays its welcome and most encounters are well designed and varied mini sandboxes inside the giant sandbox of the level itself, except for the final are but that's to be expected, and it stays far more ludonarratively coherent compared to games like Far Cry and most other open world games. The Story and Graphics were my main driving force, which is very rare for me personally since i usually get hooked to gameplay, themes, music etc. Having Playing the Previous Metro Game, I had ideas about how the game will go and it exceeded expectations, especially when you actually genuinely started caring about characters. Having a small ragtag team go on a Train Trip is as fun as it sounds. My favourite part was the train rides section between missions - Very nostalgic, the scenes were very similar to what i used to see when i used to travel a lot on trains as a kid and i loved every second of those looped scenes. For those scenes alone in various different biomes, i feel like the price i paid was justified. This was a Constructively short review based on a Purchase of the \"Gold Edition\" of the game at 75% off on a steam sale, that would be about $10(US). After completing only the base game as of now, i can recommend anyone to pick this game at nothing less than a 40% discount, ideally 75% or more. I feel like the game genuinely justifies its price even on full price, especially since according to SteamDB they have implemendted Regional Pricing so nobody's getting ripped off with unfair prices either. Game's Pretty Demanding though, both on your PC and You, as the game can get quite stressful and difficulty can be over the roof if you're not careful. I played on Hardcore and Mutant encounters were fine for me as an fps Veteran, but gradually human and other enemies got stronger and i had to tone down it to normal in certain parts to finish the game. Also, Better make good use of benchmarking tools provided with the same and i also suggest talking a look at the requirements before making a purchase. Being a single player game, some performance drops didn't bother me and the few bugs i saw were mostly animation related, and i found them quite funny tbh. These 26 hours were well spent, i got at least 3x the value of what i paid for the game in the first place. A AAA Studio made a complete game on launch, we all steam gamers scrutinized the publisher a lot for the epic exclusivity back then, but looking back its easy to see why they took the game from steam for a year. Even if the Publishers made questionable choices, there is no denying that this game oozes love and respect for the source material, the previous games, the playerbase and its own legacy to deliver a quality game and the marketing trailers of the game match so well with the actual game. The Immersion is surreal and gameplay is fantastic. I'll be trying out the DLCs too at a later date, but i have feeling they hold a high regard for quality just like the Metro Series has always been. Thanks for wasting precious hours of your delicate life reading this. I appreciate your ducking time and hope you have a ducking nice day or night or evening or afternoon or whatever the hell your time dictates.",

                "text": "Metro Exodus is a first person shooter set in the aftermath of a nuclear war, where a small group of survivors live in Moscow\u2019s underground rail network. This is the third game in the franchise, following Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light. The player once again controls Artyom, as he leads a squad of soldiers on a quest across the country.\u2022 Combat is enjoyable and fairly challenging on normal difficulty.\u2022 First 90 minutes feels very restrictive, with lots of lengthy dialogue scenes broken up by a few short combat sequences, during which you have an AI partner constantly saying \u201chey go over there, do this\u201d. Thankfully, when you reach the open world sections, the game finally backs off and allows you to explore at your own pace.\u2022 The world is a dangerous place, inhabited by several different types of enemies including Human bandits, Humanoid mutants, dogs, Watchmen (large wolf-like creatures that hunt in packs), flying demons, giant shrimp that live in lakes, giant spiders hiding in dark tunnels, and some boss level creatures that I won\u2019t spoil. Occasionally you\u2019ll notice the bandits and monsters attacking each other.\u2022 Weapons feel great to fire, and include pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle, crossbow and the Tikhar, which uses air pressure to silently fire metal balls. Each weapon can be upgraded with mods to improve damage, accuracy, clip size, as well as changing how they function, such as different types of zoom sights or silencers. You can carry three weapons, which allows your loadout to have a nice mix of short range, long range and stealth.\u2022 Its often a good idea to use stealth if possible, take out enemies silently, or avoid them completely to conserve ammo. Going loud usually attracts more enemies, and you can\u2019t recover ammo from looting monster corpses, so you could quickly run out of ammo. You can craft more ammo, but crafting resources are limited and probably better spent on medkits and gas mask filters.\u2022 Open world has a day/night cycle, and weather conditions like rain and sandstorms, which reduces visibility both for you and your enemies. Some areas are heavily irradiated, requiring you to wear a gas mask and change the filter periodically to avoid suffocating.\u2022 Main story took 19 hours to finish. There are two different endings depending on your actions during the game. (I got the good ending :D)\u2022 Main story is mostly well written.\u2022 Voice acting is fine, but I\u2019ve heard better. \u2022 Your squadmates don\u2019t just exist to shoot stuff, they\u2019re living their own lives.\u2022 Artyom is a silent protagonist like Half-Life\u2019s Gordon Freeman, which feels very weird because the other characters constantly talk to him during cutscenes. Its especially ridiculous every time they try to call him over a radio while on a mission. \u201cHey, Artyom, are you okay?\u201d. Do they expect him to answer?\u2022 I suffered some frequent stuttering, even though my PC (i7 6700K @ 4ghz, 16GB ram, GTX 1080) is comfortably above the recommended spec shown on the store page. After adjusting some settings I had a constant 60 FPS, but occasionally it would freeze for half a second, which was very noticeable when turning my mouse sideways. Strangely, this was worse in the narrow underground tunnels at the start and end of the game, and it actually performed better in the open world areas. It never hurt me during combat, but it was annoying while exploring.\u2022 Controls are fully rebindable, however there is a quite annoying bug. I prefer to use arrow keys for movement (yes, we still exist), but there are some scenes where you sit down while listening to an NPC talk and you have to use WASD to interact with objects, or to leave the conversation, meaning that I had to change my keybindings back and forth several times.\u2022 When exiting back to main menu I frequently got a message suggesting that my saved games had been corrupted. I never actually lost any progress so I always just ignored the message, however you might want to research this further before purchasing. Maybe I just got lucky.\u2022 There are two DLC missions where the player controls different characters. The first takes place during the last mission of Artyom\u2019s story, the second is set after the end of the main story.\u2022 Combat is the same high quality as the main story. The first mission adds a flamethrower to the player\u2019s arsenal.\u2022 The stories are less detailed compared to the main story.\u2022 The first mission is quite linear and lasts around 2 hours, while the second mission contains a new open world area and took me around 7 hours to finish.Metro Exodus has enjoyable combat and a good story, but is let down by some technical problems. As the game has already been out for a year on the Fortnite Kids\u2019 Anti Consumer Store, I doubt these problems will be fixed now.Still, its worth playing for fans of the FPS genre, and the Metro franchise. I bought the game plus DLC for 40% off, which feels like a fair price. If you\u2019ve never played Metro before, I\u2019d recommend picking up 2033 and Last Light, because they\u2019re also really good.",

                "text": "Metro Exodus is overall a positive experience, but not without flaws.The biggest selling points are still here, the lore, the narrative, the characters and the story. It all clicks and it's the core foundation of Metro for me, as it's what keeps the game in shape despite its flaws.I didn't enjoy a lot of new aspects which differ Exodus from previous games. The \"open world\" looks more like the one we got from Mafia 1 - sure, you can divert a little from the path and explore, but that's it, the linear progress is still here and will close behind you almost all the exits, you can't just \"go back\" and collect missing stuff or finish open cases. Speaking of those, there are no side quests of any kind, the \"best\" you can have are a few small activities which all look the same - go kill/knock out everybody around and retrieve an item or pull a lever, that's it.The open world on the other hand is completely empty, the only thing that exists are enemy encounters, you can't get rid of them even on the easiest difficulties where they just spawn and you have to kill or sneak past them, there is very little opportunity to explore, it feels more like a chore of the main quest that makes you visit almost all of the point of interests that are interesting, because everything else is not. I think I found literally ONE location at caspian sea which looked interesting yet the main quest didn't make me go there, and I explored whole map on each level.Personally I enjoyed the linear story of the first metros more, the \"affair\" with the open world didn't end well in my eyes, yes, the game is indeed located mostly in open areas as opposed to claustrophobic metro tunnels, but that's pretty much everything the game has to offer - the locations are indeed designed well and unique as the places you find yourself in, but the moment you start exploring you notice that it's all empty world that tells no story at all, even Fallout 4 did better job here by having a lot of locations that were simply interesting to explore without any quest forcing you to go inside.I'm still leaving Exodus a positive note, because it's still the Metro universe I love and it'd be unfair to put equality sign between badly designed \"open world\" or underwhelming crafting mechanics and the excellent narrative, story and the lore. It's still a very good game to play, but personally I enjoyed the claustrophobic prequels far more, where you could feel the struggle of living and explored locations were polished to perfection, as opposed to the \"open world\" we got that feels rushed and boring.If you've enjoyed previous Metro games and you're into the lore, you certainly won't be disappointed. As a starting point, I discourage, you'll get thrown into the middle of action with characters you don't know, and the mechanics won't keep you for much longer alone.---If you liked my review, you can find more of them on  and on my .",

                "text": "I feel Metro Exodus is a step forwards and two step back....For those who love open world exploring then you're in a treat, because Metro Exodus offers that. But at the same time I feel this in't Metro anymore. When I first play Metro, it's because it's literally inside a Metro, it was so unique and mind blowing how people built their new life inside a Metro system. There was nothing like this even till today. Only Metro game you get to see it. Now having an open world is nice, but I feel the developers were lazy, because the world is fun to explore yet at times feel dead and dull, since there's no real form of missions or any sense of requirement for you to explore. Sure it's better to explore it and get all the best equipment, but you don't actually need it to complete the game. It's like you have to use your own imagination to have fun with it....if I were to do that I wouldn't be playing a game, I would learn to be a game developer instead. Battles / gunfights are lot more mediocre too....even on the Main Story line, It's not as epic and engaging as the previous two games. Hard to put it into words, but as I said when I play Metro Exodus it doesn't give me that sort of engaging and sense of a SP, but rather more like a MMO RPG Online game...It feels \" dull \" yet the game have so much potential....I actually had more fun in the DLC called Two Colonel...that's the easiest way I can explain my dissatisfaction with Metro Exodus. In a Nutshell, the game is great, I had fun, but It could have been better. And If I were to recommend a Metro game, I most likely would easily recommend Last Light / 2033 Redux instead, not because those are the Prequel, but I find those overall a better Metro games. Even when it lack the mechanic and gameplay Exodus offers. But I'm still gonna thumb it up. It's a Good game, but definitely not a Masterpiece or the Sequel I was expecting.",

                "text": "+ Absolutely stunning graphics+ Perfectly executed animation+ Unforgettable opening titles+ Variety of different locations through the game+ Pretty unusual experience compared to the previous games of the series because of the road trip on the Soviet train+ Much more mindblowing action scenes+ The gunplay is purely amazing+ The atmosphere and tone of this game are very unique + Very emotional and captivating story+ Detailed weapon customization options   - Too much of QTE, that feels annoying and out of place from time to time- It can be hardly called open world game in the usual sense of this expression- Minor bugs here and there After the decision of the publishers to take the game away from Steam to make is Epic Store exclusive at the eleventh hour, I was put in a tricky position. Either I just turn my back to the game series or I purchase the game while I still able to do it on Steam. There is no need to discuss something that has been said a million times already regarding this situation. So this review is for the people who care about the game series and Metro universe in general instead of focusing on the Epic Store drama aspect.My biggest fear was that Metro Exodus would lose its soul and atmosphere of the claustrophobic sense, in those narrow subway tunnels, full of bandits and creepy monsters, because of the developers\u2019 decision to make a road trip game. Luckily, they were managed to keep the needed atmosphere despite the fact that all the events take place on a surface. However, I still have kind of mixed feelings about this game, simply because of the weird mixture of different locations and incessant feelings that Metro Exodus tries to refer to some other popular representatives of the genre. Metro Exodus starts with a short monologue of Artyom, briefly telling the players about what happened to him and his life during the events of the previous games. At the end of this monologue, he says he is not going to stop until he finds a way to stop this madness to come back to the normal life. During one of his regular raids, he finds a Soviet-era steam train called the Aurora. From that point, Artyom and a few Spartan soldiers begin a long journey across post-apocalyptic Russia to get the answers on the most important questions and find a good place to start a new life.Of course, the major innovation for the game series is that Artyom finally leaves Metro and goes on a big road trip alongside with his squad and beloved woman. During this road trip, they will make a series of different stops to complete certain objectives like finding a fuel, water or even a trolley to continue their journey. The diversity of landscapes and locations is absolutely amazing: first, you see an abandoned village full of crazy religious fanatics, then you end up in the desert with neverending sandstorms and in the next scene you are fighting against the wild forest people, etc. However, it\u2019s really important to state that this game is not a classical open world game. Basically, it still remains the same linear game as it was before, the only difference is that the train makes stops from time to time and during these stops you have the ability to explore these lands. Don\u2019t expect to see enormous maps with tons of different stuff to do: usually, it\u2019s a pretty limited map with the main objective and a few side quests where you have to find some lost goods, get rid of the bandits or help someone who is in trouble. First I was excited and promised myself to finish all these side quests, but then I just got bored with them and focused on the main quest primarily, simply because they were not that special or interesting enough. You can clearly feel how Metro Exodus has been supported with a much bigger budget and it looks much more polished but still feels like the original Metro games. Now it\u2019s simply stuffed with actions scenes with QTE and some breathtaking cutscenes during the most dramatic moments. At some point, there were too much of these scenes that I felt like I was already tired of those QTE and neverending madness on the screen. Following the traditions of previous games in the series, Artyom is always one step away from death. It happens so often that it just becomes funny at the end and the player starts to believe that this guy is simply immortal and extra lucky. I lost my account of how many times I was unarmed simply because someone attacked the protagonist again and he was able to survive or run away at the very last second. The game is much more improved in terms of the combat as well. At the very first moment when I got the chance to kill a monster from my AK-47, I felt a huge difference comparing to the previous games. Metro can be played in a stealth mode as well, where Artyom can turn off the lights, blow out the candles and shoot the lanterns to avoid getting caught. All these weapons can be modified and upgraded, this is something that has been improved as well. Now every single weapon slot has a preset, where you can choose which weapon you want to take for the next mission. Every single modifier that you find on the enemies\u2019 dead bodies will be added to your inventory so you can attach them to your weapons next time you are near the workbench. The worst thing that Metro Exodus has from the previous games is bugs and glitches alongside with a not so clever AI. Sometimes enemies can just look in your direction and wait for a few seconds before start shooting and mutants can act really weird, especially at some absolutely dark levels. Not to mention texture stuck issues and some voice stuttering during the dialogues.        Metro Exodus is absolutely gorgeous in terms of graphics. Through the whole journey, you will see the astonishing desert with the dried-out Caspian Sea, dull and atmospheric village full of crazy fanatics, beautiful sceneries of the frozen rivers and snowy mountains. I couldn\u2019t stop admiring the detailing of each location and how they managed to work on them to bring us such quality content in the end. Like every single game of the series, Metro Exodus is provided with a high-quality voice dubbing and atmospheric ambient sounds. It has some minor issues with stuttering and voices laying over each other from time to time, but it doesn\u2019t happen that often to strongly focus on this.Metro Exodus is a massive project that has been developed with a soul and it tells you a great story about the journey, family and how it\u2019s important to fight for yourself and for your happiness. The developers took a chance by creating a completely different game bringing the protagonists out of Metro on the surface and they didn\u2019t fail. Highly recommended for every single Metro series fan.",

Some crashes are even consistent and prevent you from progressing, unless you hit the jackpot after dozens of tries.It's a shame because it doesnt seem like they still offer support for it, so these issues will probably never be fixed.After more than a week of going back and forth through multiple emails with their Customer Support, trying to help them find the issue and solve it, this is the latest reply i've got: So according to them, the game has no issues and anyone who has problems with Metro Exodus is delusional.",

The gun combat was enhanced into a more satisfying yet unforgiving system, where the true felling of \"post-apocalyptic survival shooter\" comes into play, especially on higher difficulties (fighting several enemies at the same time will often result on the player's death). Pros: - Interesting places to explore with many secondary locations.-Excellent narrative and character building, culminating on the ending of the game (the game has 2 different endings which will depend on the player's choices throughout the game).- Lots of guns/bullets crafting.- Very atmospheric scenarios and sounds (typical of the Metro series).Cons: - Despite having big areas for exploration the game is not really open world. The player progresses in a train an can't go back to previous explored areas.- The game pacing changes because the player will mostly be exploring open areas and no longer Metro areas (due to how the story develops). Depending on the player this could be either a good or a bad new setting, though.",

                "text": "If you find this review to be helpful, my curators page is here: This is the third game in the Metro series, and is an easy sell for previous fans. It's the same mixture of environmental hazards, scavenging, melee and ranged combat, tense set-pieces, and boisterous OTT story-telling that the series has consistently delivered. The open world setting does make levels freer to explore, and allows for the game to expand in a pleasant way that doesn't dilute it's best qualities. It's not fundamentally all that different to play, but it does freshen up those aspects that were perhaps in danger of getting stale, and without sacrificing their talents at making intense or scary directed moments.For those who are unfamiliar with the Metro games: They take place in Russia, after a nuclear war has left the landscape uninhabitable and the survivors have fled underground into the train tunnels. Life is tough, and above ground has radiation and mutants, but there are relatively comfortable communities making it from day to day. You play as Artyom, an optimistic every-man who gets drawn into the fight for survival against foes that range from men to monsters, to advanced beings with control of time and space. Y'know...the usual post-apocalyptic USSR stuff, which is solidly constructed rather than anything ground-breaking.It's voice-acting is usually overdone, and the characterisation can be a tad iffy (most Russians are apparently a bit loud and blustery?) so it has never been totally convincing on the narrative front. However, it has also never failed  to deliver an engaging mixture of FPS combat, survival elements, and exciting sequences of tension and terror. You're not a cyborg super soldier, or roided up bad-ass military guy, and this is a world where your gun is powered by a bicycle pump, and whether or not you have any ammo for it will depend on if you want to eat your last potato for health, or use it as a projectile to try and brain someone with it.I'm kidding about the potato, but bullets are both your money, and...uh...well, things you shoot with. The most potent weapons will be guns, and so are costly to actually fire, or you can have air-powered weapons that are cheaper to produce ammo for, but don't pack as much punch. It's a game where lots of little touches add up to a fairly unique flavour: some areas require using a gas mask, and finding top-ups for it's filters. You can get dirt and blood splattered over the visor, and will have to wipe it off. Your torch is powered by cranking the handle, and bringing up the map is an actual \"physical\" object Artyom retrieves and looks at.This isn't Fallout, or Dying Light, when it comes to it's crafting mechanics. You don't just get some wires, a few Duracell batteries, some double-sided sticky tape, and a gun, then slap it all together A-Team style to make a rail-gun that shoots beams of energy. It's not Call Of Duty where you're firing off a gun so powerful that it takes bionic arms just to carry it, and then you call in a death-beam strike from an outer-space satellite. Generally you'll probably be going down the stealth route, and are shooting them with a cobbled together air-rifle that sounds like a duck politely farting, or getting up close for some stabbing / neck-breaking.Fire-fights are for bourgeoisie capitalist pig-dogs, with money to almost literally burn, as it goes up in smoke with every bullet fired. It's a balancing act trying to get by with the cheaper, less effective weapons, so you can eventually afford to purchase upgrades to improve them, or save up for something better, but that is also more costly to use. On the higher difficulty levels it's a tough enough challenge that in the first game of the series, I couldn't ever afford to buy a new weapon throughout the entire campaign. On this third game they've softened that challenge a little bit (in some ways, at least) and searching every nook and cranny will yield all the items, or all the bits and pieces for crafting useful additions. It's smoother to progress, but limits to your inventory, relatively scarce resources, and the levels of enemy opposition, mean it's still not easy.It can be played as a run-and-gunner, and the combat is slick enough to satisfy. Though stealth is a viable option too, and enemies have varying states of alertness and responsiveness to threats. Mechanically this is very polished across all of its elements, and by now is super-slick with it's set-pieces. With plenty of capacity for tension, scares, and thrills, these nicely break up the \"loose\" action for more tightly controlled sequences.Story-wise it's engaging enough, but I'd be lying if I said this was ever it's strongest suit. This is about immersion in it's world, the sense of place and atmosphere that the excellent graphics and soundscape help to convey, and all those things that ground you in it. The involvement with your weapons and utilities, as you pump them up in the heat of battle, or furiously wind up your torch to see in pitch-black locations. Hearing your character desperately sucking in handfuls of corrupt air as your last filter runs out, and you're stumbling around searching for another before suffocating. Around you there's weird phantoms of long-dead people going about their business in an echo of the distant past, and there's no time to pay this bizarre anomaly much mind when there's the somewhat more pressing matter of ensuring you can breathe.The adrenaline rush of hard-fought encounters, or nervously creeping through the shadows unseen. That huge sigh of relief as you make it to a quiet moment after all that tension. There's a stretch where mutants aren't trying to tear your face off, and people aren't shooting at you, and the only thing you have to pay any mind to is the hum of a geiger counter. Just as you get comfortable, something bursts out of a nearby lake, or out of the ground, or from the sky, and you are reminded that you can never be truly at ease in this world. It is possible to appreciate this without playing the previous games, as it doesn't riff particularly heavily on events from the first two. Though some familiarity, and connection to the characters, will make it's twists and turns that extra bit more poignant or involving. For the most part this release is a very enjoyable final to the trilogy (the voice-work, whilst not bad, isn't great either, but that's it's main flaw), and I highly recommend it.",

                "text": "As a fan of the original Stalker and the Metro games following it, I loved the Slavic take on the post apocalyptic world-building compared to that of the rest of Europe and America with it's mostly Happy-Go-Lucky games like Fallout, Borderlands (not in America but an American developer anyways). Something about the cold nuclear winters, frost kicking onto your visor as  you wipe it off with a dedicated hand button and the constant ticking of the Gieger counter firmly reminded you that the world with the now-deranged mother nature is far more dangerous foe than anything you will face. When it is shown that the new Metro game will take place mostly outside of Metro, fans were rightly skeptical as one of the core series strength was always the dark interconnected tunnels of the Metro stations of Moscow which drenched in atmosphere which other games in the genre could hardly come even close to. After having played this game in hardcore difficulty, which took me around 30 hours as I took my time as I usually do in these sort of games; I am happy to say that the new open environments are not detrimental to the series core, in fact the the claustrophobic metro sections are still there in the game and elevated up several notches in atmosphere.This game at its heart is probably the closest to Half-Life 3 and a true Crysis sequel we are ever going to it. The one year journey as the game takes you across the desolate Russia with your wife and the people of your \u2018Order\u2019 evoked me feels of Half-Life which I have not gotten for so many years, damn I missed that. The maps are not open world, but many are very large, giving you multiple ways to tackle problems, just like Crysis. Also debuting is a on-site attachment system, again similar to Crysis in many ways. That is not to say the game simply borrows everything and calls it a day, there is still the Metro atmosphere which really gels everything together. You have a mobile hub, a train called the Aurora. Here the game becomes a little bit like immersive sims like Deus Ex. Here you get to talk with your crew and play with the weapon modifications. I was surprised how lengthy dialogue can get with you or when the crew is talking amongst themselves. It is a non-issue as you are forced to listen to everything, but I like how the dialogs were often long and felt \u2018real\u2019 as opposed to a minute or two conversations. These Aurora sections bring the much needed downtime, especially when you consider how brutal the game can get at times. The thing which bothers me a lot unfortunately is the English voice acting, it is simply not good most the time, minus your wife Anna. It feels like an amatuer person reading off the script, also the voice writing is off for me as well. I heard it sounds a lot better in Russian and it does, however it hurts my gameplay as I constantly checking the subtitles will force you to the bottom third of the screen a lot of the time as you would be missing out a lot in front of you. You don\u2019t want to miss out on that one as Metro Exodus, just like it\u2019s peers, is gorgeous. It now has a dynamic day/night cycle and RTX users can enjoy true Global Illumination which makes the game look even more realistic. Even if you don\u2019t have RTX GPU, the game is absolutely jaw dropping on my GTX 970. I get a good 45-60fps on high settings and the frame rate mostly stays high during combat so it doesn\u2019t bother me. Although bear in mind that the frame rate can vary a lot depending on the location you are in and what you are looking in front of you. There are some off low resolution textures on certain objects here and there, which is a shame but not a deal breaker but overall though, this game is a stunner and easily one of the best looking games out there on the PC.I played it Hardcore difficulty and I suggest everyone to start playing from this difficulty as it tunes the game the way it is meant to be played. Ammo and crafting supplies will be scarce, I had to make difficult decisions like breaking down my ammo for some materials to craft a filter for my mask for example. On this difficulty, you will regularly making such decisions, although it never it felt like it is the focus like a disaster management game. It made me appreciate the gameplay systems even more. The gunfights can be very lethal on hardcore difficulty. 2-3 shots or a shotgun blast can kill you, same rule applies to the enemies. The enemies are challenging because of this, but unfortunately the AI isn\u2019t that good. They take cover and aim pretty good but they never force you to fall back rethink your move. Careful planning and the right gear with the right modifications can make all the difference.Speaking of gear, the weapons and items in metro exodus looks and feels very real. It has that raw look which tech and junk strapped together to make it function which I love. Weapons will degrade overtime in the weather, and will cause it to jam or shoot off the mark when it happens. So it is always a good idea to take note of your gear before heading out. There are also crafting stations outside of the Aurora which will allow you to make ammo and clean the weapons.I did not feel much for the story but in the end it truly grabbed me. It shows the desperation of how far we will go for the people we love. As someone who lost the love of his life very recently, it teared me up. Rachaelle my love, if you read this, I am sorry I failed you.They simply do not make games like this anymore. It was longer than I expected as it took me around 30 hrs to beat in my own pace. It is very unfortunate the steam/epic thing blew to the point the game suffered in the public view. For those are waiting for the steam version of the game, trust me this game will be worth the wait. Make no mistake, this is a great game...one which I wish my girl friend watched me play from...wherever she is...=========My System=========Windows 10 proIntel Core i5 4570GTX 970 OCed16GB RAMSamsung 840 EVO SSDGame installed on a Western Digital Green HDD",
