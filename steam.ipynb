I felt it was kind of my duty to give my opinion on the game that I have personally been waiting for over 6 years, as Warband happens to be -if not the- one of my all time favourite games (with around 1100 hours of gamplay - yes I know, still rookie numbers compared to some other of its fans, but still, that\\'s a considerable amount of my life\\'s time).So, I have -as of now- played 63 hours of Bannerlord and another 155 hours of the multiplayer beta of which I had the honor of being a part. I now feel confident enough to talk about why I think that you should get the game yourself, especially if you loved any of its previous titles.First of all, the game is aesthetically a HUGE development from the awkward indie 2010 (that -even then- still felt older) graphics, which we all grew to love. The animations seem more realistic, the items more detailed, the campaign map is incredible and the scenery (from the snowy forests of Sturgia to the desert wastelands of the Aserai homeland, and from the rocky Battanian villages to the great cities of the Empire) is beautiful and at times even -dare I say- majestic. Sure, the graphics still don\\'t compare to the other big games of its time, and the character models still look a bit odd, but for a game of a small company like Taleworlds that chooses to focus more on the gameplay and the game\\'s mechanics, you can at least overlook some of their flaws.I should also point out here that the game takes place around 200 years before the events of Warband, in a world where the Calradic Empire still exists, although in crisis, and new and old kingdoms arise in its wake. Some of the factions are the ones that evolved into the ones in Warband (Vlandia is the predecessor to the Swadians and the Rhodoks, Sturgia is a mix between the Vaegirs and the Nords, the Khuzaits are the khanate before the rise of the Khergits, and the Aserai the previous Sultanate to the Sarranids), while we also have the Battanians (a celtic-like mountain kingdom) and the Calradic Empire (an empire very similar to the medieval Greco-Roman -now known as Byzantine- Empire). Each of these factions is very well made in order to feel unique and different to the others, with its own architecture, clothing style and troops, that are very close to their historical inspirations, giving you a nice depiction of some fields of what the actual medieval world looked like (and in some cases how it worked).Now, for Single Player, on a first look you\\'d say \"That\\'s an enhanced version of Warband\" and you\\'d may be right for the most part, but the game offers many new features and details that differentiate it from its predecessor. Examples of this are the many convenience options, like the way you can recruit troops from villages and towns which can be more and better if you have good relations with the village\\'s notables or the fact that you can see the full items\\' stats and compare them to your own. There are many new features, like the Clan and its mechanics (basically you, your family and your companions), the fact that you can have children and continue to play as them once your older character finally kicks the bucket, the forging system which allows you to make weapons and choose how they will look on your own, the new Kingdom Mechanics, that enhance the experience of serving or ruling a realm with multiple armies and kingdom laws, and the fact that you can now kill nobles that you capture, with whatever consequences that may entail. Other features have been renewed, fixing annoying issues that existed in Warband or completely changing the way they worked for the better, like, for example, the new massive battles with more thought out AI-planning, and the sieges, that now have siege weapons and are not just a mass of angry people cramming a small ladder only to get violently killed by the other mass of angry people that awaits them on the walls.For Multiplayer, there are now 3 main modes, which are Skirmish 6v6 (which is like battle and conquest together), Captain 6v6 (which allows every player to command a small band of troops) and Siege (which is the good ol\\' siege we all know and love, polished with siege weapons and some new mechanics). There is also a Team Deathmatch mode which is more like a playground to prepare you for the real modes above. Now, the way the combat works is almost the same as in Warband (with some minor changes like a shield bash move, a crouch move and chain attacks) and I feel like it is what we should expect, even though I hear complaints about it being \"clunky\" and \"unreliable\". I personally enjoy it as I did in Warband and I\\'d say it is highly dependent on skill and experience (I believe it\\'s hard to learn and to master, but once you do, it offers you a very fun and challenging experience). Of course, there are still many issues and bugs which make you question the fact that this is a game that was in development for 8 years and that it is priced as much as it is. If you buy it now, mind that you will come across a lot of them. That being said, you should also keep in mind that this is still Early Acccess and many of them are bound to change. Also, you have to AT LEAST give credit to the developers for keeping track with the complaints and the feedback of the players, having already made 10 updates (during the first 10-11 days since the release!) and continuing strong. Honestly, the way they keep hunting for issues and bugs and the way they listen to negative feedback is all I could ask from a game studio (which, again, is not a major one) and, if anything, deserves my support in this journey of making the game that we all have dreamt and still dream of.Overall (and sorry for this lengthy essay), the game is a worthy successor to Warband. It offers you a pretty similar experience that Warband did (letting you explore a vast world of different cultures and giving you the freedom to make your own story, whether it is of the journeys of a merchant, the adventures of a warlord, the path of terror left behind by a bandit leader, or the rise of a new ruler) which is exactly what we should all have expected and hoped for. And yet, even as a game that offers content and possibilities the size (and even significantly bigger than the size) of Warband, it still feels like it has not even scratched the surface of what it is capable of, leaving space to be filled in ways that we haven\\'t even immagined by the many and various mods that are bound to follow (and have already started making their entrance) by the ever restless and creative modding community of Mount&Blade. So, if you have waited for this game like I have and still wonder if you should buy it in its current state I\\'d say, yes, join this journey, because even if it\\'s not yet all you have dreamt of, given time and support it\\'s going to be. If you are new to Mount&Blade, and think that it is a little overpriced for a game that is not fully completed yet, you can always wait until it comes out of EA, but I would personally recommend that you give it a go, and in the end you will be glad you did.', helpful='1,305 people found this review helpful, 25 people found this review funny', rewards=9, hrs_on_record=170.6),\n",
       " SteamReview(text=\"With 2,192 hours in Warband, I think it's safe to say that I've experienced my fair share of the classic Warband experience that Bannerlord is not only trying to emulate but also build upon. With 15 hours in the game, I'm already of the belief that Taleworlds will not only achieve this end, but surpass it.The game is buggy, yes. Some of the bugs are obnoxious, yes. There are portions of content missing that are sorely needed. Not only is this true, but the disappointment surrounding it is understandable. After 8 years of waiting, 10 for some, this series has cultivated a cult following of dedicated and loving fans, myself very much included, who want nothing more than to dive head first into the game.But it's very much an early access and anyone who finds themselves overly disappointed by the state of the game needs to remind themselves that it is still in its infancy. Even now, the content included in the game is entertaining; compared to Warband, combat actually feels weighty, and adventuring around Calradia has a heightened sense of danger and excitement to it. Side activities such as smithing allow for those interested in roleplay to create deeper stories for their characters, and core mechanics such as trading have been developed and enhanced in this new release to feel far more responsive and rewarding.It is clear from the two very quick patches it has already seen that this early access is one that Taleworlds are committed to building upon. Bugs will be worked out, content will be added, and I am firmly of the faith that the game will continue to evolve and take shape over the coming days, weeks and months. Everyone is well within their rights to leave a negative review, but I would encourage people not to damage the game's rating unfairly, as the current release is not indicative of the finished product.The thing that Bannerlord needs right now is committed players to continue to highlight issues so that they can be resolved. The framework provided to us now sets a good vision for the final product, and I can't wait to see that vision be fulfilled.\", helpful='1,815 people found this review helpful, 36 people found this review funny', rewards=2, hrs_on_record=91.9),\n",

       " SteamReview(text=\"Great game. Started playing during the second lockdown. Finished the game to the point of having my own empire, reaching the ability to fight multiple wars with over 380 troops in my personal army. Ambushed by groups of 800-100 and held small passages with 150 fian champions, a shield wall and just enough cavalry to route the enemy. Had every companion in my personal bodyguard unit and was run down by a flanking cavalary charge, most of my unit was dismounted, we had to fight our way back to our line. Ordered our shieldwall to take tremendous losses to get us back into the fighting. Creating a tusudo (square formation) around the companions and bodyguard unit while we fought against the 2 v 1 odds (realistic difficulty). Lost 90% of my army, most of my companions but we won that battle. When we get out, we siege the enemy castle with just enough soldiers to push the ram. We knock down the reinforced doors and engage in a skirmish. The companions start to fall, members who were with me from the beginning. My troops are outnumbered, holding a small room near the gate. The balance of power is slowly creeping in the right direction. We are down to the last 20 enemies. We have 9 of us left, holding the doorway the best that we can. I take a javelin to the head, instant K.O. My units keep fighting, my bodyguard with insane leadership and tactics, reforms the wall and finds 30 or so troops that I mismanaged to come around and flank. I watch the battle incapacitated, the units left on our side is under 10. The units left on there side is under 10. We get to 3 each, companions vs. enemy leaders. My wife is one of the companions, my brother Nogrand is the other. The last companion is a surgeon who somehow made it this far. He dies but not before he throws a perfect javelin and takes one of the enemy commanders. Nogrand and my wife are melee specialists, almost maxed fighting stats with pillaged level 6 weapons. They hold, they wound both the last commanders. We take the castle, executing the commanders. But this isn't over. We, 265 wounded, an effective fighting force of 2 with my character health at 1% are about to come under siege from a nearby army. The nearby army sets the castle under siege. Hours turn to days, the army of 600 is ready to fight and in the distance I see our last hope. I see the first lord I recruited in my battle against the empire. The lord I spent years chasing as a mercenary, relentlessly beating in battle to gain charm points... he with an army of 400 is charging this way in what looks like a rally to protect is king, his commander, his lord! He stops and watches my no save, death on, realistic campaign's final moments. He sits there, watching this enemy army take down our walls with trebs and in the last second... just as they start to storm the gates, my number 2, my favourite lord... just sits there. We lose the campaign, we fight to the end and with a valiant last stand my party is killed in battle. It is over, my sons killed, my wife murdered and staring at my 300 hours campaign, satisfied that the next time; i'm going to behead that lord and his entire family the first time we meet.

       " SteamReview(text='Great game... who need 1 or 2 years of development. tl;dr: mid game turn into a micromanagment hell.The game is fantastic until a certain point. You start as a mercenary, one party, 50-150 soldiers doing missions, small battles or bigger fights joining armies. Good graphics, brutal engagments with 200-1000 units at the same time if your computer can handle, playing as a soldier is a blast.The problems start when you get a few towns and a bigger family, the micromanagement never stops and gets worse overtime. You have to physically move your party to towns to fix their issues. When your lords get captured & escapes, they\\'ll go into a random town until you pick em again, then you\\'ll have to reform the party. Same with caravanes for trading, if they get captured, you\\'ll have to go in his town and recreate the caravan. You have to partially fill towns with soldiers, manually, from your own soldiers. All the little fun things of the beginning soon become a hassle, as you can\\'t delegate. Messengers are not a thing.You can\\'t manage a town at a distance, you can\\'t tell a party member to move to a location or guard a territory, they do whatever they want if they\\'re out of your army / party, so you have to do it yourself. Either you\\'re leading your huge army to fight what is basically an enless war mid game, or you take care of your cities while the rest of your faction fight... with various success. Some commanders are pretty good, other will throw waves of recruits at highly trained arbalists in the open backed with cavalry. Protip: don\\'t be a recruit in an imperial army.You can\\'t tell a party you created to guard an area or to kill all bandits attacking your villagers, it\\'s up to you, or the IA if it feel like it. Worst, if you let the parties you created roam around (parties = group of 70-200 soldiers under a lord) they can be (temporarily) drafted in other armies of your kingdom... and you\\'ll have to physically move to the army, talk to the leader and pay some reputation to get them back. Of course, large armies are slow. This leads the the next problem, swarms.My worst fear is not a massive army, it\\'s an army disbanded in the middle of my territory. The small parties usually start raiding all villages in the vicinity while being too fast to be catched by a big army. Raided villages impact your town / castle loyalty and gold quite heavily. Sure, you could disband your army and hunt them yourself... but that makes you take a step back, and all your parties would reform under another army you can\\'t control. And man, some army commanders are really, really stupid. Verdun style charge in the open against walls of archers, cavalry in a forest vs pikemens, you name it. I can\\'t count the time i had parties wiped in someone else army. But let\\'s say you managed to capture the lords burning your villages.The capture system is broken. Captured lords escape A LOT. I had some escape 20 seconds after being captured. They never stay in a jail for more than a few in game days. Once they escape, they magically teleport to their hometown, rebuild a fast 80 mens army in the blink of an eye and go back to raiding villages. AI \"cheat\" with recruits, they will always find soldiers in town, even if they\\'re empty for you. Executions you say?If you execute a lord, no matter how much of an A-hole he/she is, the whole faction will hate you. He raided dozens of villages and killed hundreds of peasants? Still not good enough. You just can\\'t kill a lord without suffering heavy consequences down the line, and you\\'ll need those lords to be friendly later. Worth to mention, capturing the leader of a faction won\\'t stop a war.Last - peace / war is on/off. I had 600 days of continuous war, followed by 600 days of complete peace in the entire map (due to a bug apparently), and i\\'m now back at 300 days of war. Not a single day of peace, when one war stop another start immediatly. They will just never, ever stop fighting. Can\\'t catch a breath, can\\'t leave the front of your lose towns.Oh and the main quest randomly failed after 875 days or so.I would still recommand the game, it\\'s really fun for a while but it need a HUGE QoL update.', helpful='398 people found this review helpful, 10 people found this review funny', rewards=40, hrs_on_record=113.3),\n",
       " SteamReview(text=\"Short version: If there was a tentative recommendation button, I'd be using it. It very much depends on the person, because while most people praise the game, there is a serious contingent that have reasons not to. The company has a history of promising big things and then using a second game to finish fulfilling them. If that turns you off, I don't blame you. It doesn't bother me as long as the first game is good in its own right, but I can agree that we shouldn't have to buy a second game to get what was promised. It's a good core for a game, but there are plenty of bugs I've seen. I tried walking the streets of Baltikhand and had a CTD while loading them in. I repeated the process to verify that the crash was a consistent thing. So stay off the streets of that town and just hit the trade and recruitment screens there. I'm having issues with attribute points not being given to me at every third level like they're supposed to be. I'm sure it'll get fixed but as of this review I haven't seen it happen. Also having a hard time leveling up charm skill despite following the instructions given in the tooltip. Not sure if it's a true bug, or if the tooltip isn't telling the whole story. I'll have to wait and see. All that being said, I adore what this game is doing with the series. We have families now. Not just a marriage for an alliance, but an actual clan, with potential for children, and a brother built right into the story. We're the head of a clan, not just a nobody adventurer making it on their own. It's very Crusader Kings II to me, and I'm loving everything I get into. There's even a politics system where we can spend influence to vote on land assignment, and we can spend that influence to put laws up to vote that have actual impacts on the stability and power balances within our Kingdoms. Being a vassal doesn't just have to mean warring, we can use our built in influence to do politics as well. Overall, I love it. If you're on the fence and don't want to spend 40 or 50 dollars on it yet, wishlist it, watch the patch notes, and see how it looks when it goes on sale for real. For the rest of you, I understand the hate and don't blame you. I just don't share it, and I recommend anyone with an interest at least keep an eye on it.Update: 400 hours in and almost a year after release, they've done a lot of bugfixing. They've also done a bit of fleshing out and adding in features. I can definitely say I've already gotten my money's worth from it, and I've been YouTubing it as well. It still suffers some problems from the old games so far. The combat gets samey and isn't all that balanced. There seems to be a big tendency toward telling things rather than showing them proper, and this isn't helped by gameplay and story segregation. Though I could honestly see the gameplay and story segregation being intentional. There IS a main quest chain with a story to it, and there's room to interpret that quest as pretty much poking holes in a lot of the flavor text. Again, not sure if intentional and if it is it's not really that smart a move on their part, but it's there if you want to read into it.I'm still giving the game my tentative yes. If you like the series and just want more Warband, this is definitely for you. If not, keep watching or look into other games.\", helpful='1,243 people found this review helpful, 31 people found this review funny', rewards=2, hrs_on_record=478.6),\n",

It's an investment in the future really.The gameplay is a mixed bag atm.The main game loop feels pretty polished and satisfying.Combat is great, challenging, a bit better than in Warband.Smithing is an amazing crafting minigame and one of the best new features of BL. You smelt, refine, discover new parts, and explore new unique weapon combinations as you make your own gorgeous weapons. Make some of the best, most beautiful weapons yourself, and use them to chop chop smash smash! Thanks for that BL!The UI.. now allows for easy micromanagement. Significant quality of life improvements here.The whole game is vanilla, rough, unbalanced.Some mechanics don't work yet, or work poorly. Like don't try to get your brother married, it won't work. Don't get married, don't save your brother. You can, but you might not be able to access their inventories.Main quest can be impossible to complete.. you can only complete as vassal, the game doesn't know you are an independent faction when you are in fact.. an independent faction.Troop trees are rough and basic and copy-paste vanilla values, uninteresting to explore.Characters can be missing, impossible to find, stuck in some castle while in fact are not in that castle. The game points to Location A when in fact you can find them in Location B, somewhere probably.. near Location A. Or not.Characters can sometimes be teleporting around like Nonsense.Smithing, which I like a lot.. is beyond OP and completely crazy broken. Mild spoilers.. at least for now, until they fix their sht.. While Workshops are very hard to figure out, make very little, and most will not make any money at all. As in: zero.Kingdom features are broken or questionable. Like Clans, which are now your vassals, they are a mess. Instead of getting auto-offers from AI, Clans are hard to get, easy to lose and unfairly destroy relations. This makes Kingdom almost impossible.Peace offers from the AI will not happen. But you can buy peace with money, and since money is not an issue atm, it's just silly.Parties are poorly maintained AI armies that you pay for, they do not auto-recruit, but will get themselves captured and will waste valuable troops.Sieges have various issues. Like 1 guy unreachable forever will make you fail the siege. Troops management is a mess. Broken walls could be more like messy bottlenecks, but sometimes are simply turning a siege into a field battle, aka.. not much sieging gameplay if you simply break walls. Opening gates from the inside is tough, but when it works, it's silly and OP. I also had a few crashes after sieges.Most castles are not yet in game, there are just a few, and a ton of copy-paste, so not much interest in sieging the same castle again and again.XP seems pretty broken, it's extremely easy to get to around lvl 13-15ish, and then.. pfff. XP requirements for companions are simply broken. They will not lvl up, not this century at least. You finish the game and they are still 1-2 lvls away from where they started.Executions are.. a questionable feature, that simply splits the game in: either you do it, play a quicker, much simpler and more repetitive game, make a ton of enemies, potentially ruin your character, ruin diplomacy, be forced to go down the genocide path.. and bypass any reason to siege or make a Kingdom. Or not do it, play the long game of building good relations with the nobility, but miss all the murdering fun, secretly wish you could do it, and cry yourself to sleep every night. And end up in a mess with your Kingdom anyway. The problem here is.. you can easily lamify the game by executing all nobles. And instead of a juicy, rewarding, emotionally messy and mechanically complex end game, you just chop chop chop chop chop... THE END.The UI again! Needs more clarity, focus, better framing, better organisation, less clutter, more consistency and polish. Upgrades are hard to figure out at first, a bit odd, and the grey shield icons over the Skills that can upgrade are simply not visible enough, they should be Colorful Bright Glowy Animated [with a color that stands out]! Personally I prefer the grid structure of the Warband inventory.The frequent, entirely useless, and poorly designed autosave.. doesn't async save in the background. It freezes the game for a few seconds. You can't turn it off.And for now.. some crashes may happen, depending on how you play and what you may try.Last but not least.. press N to access the Encyclopedia! There should be a large button for it in the main UI/world view, it's essential!Cheers!\", helpful='637 people found this review helpful, 22 people found this review funny', rewards=101, hrs_on_record=97.8),\n",

If they keep up the good work we'll probably have a fully-featured working game much sooner than anticipated:).Ok let's be real:This is a 2014 early access game that was released in 2020. I love it, it's buggy, it's mount and blade, it's love. BUΤ:1)Game is buggy, so buggy that you should not only save often, but also in multiple saves cause there are many, many game-breaking bugs that force the player to start over if there's no other way to avoid loopholes.2)Game is not only unfinished, but also feels not properly tested too. Several bugs and missing textures are noticable right from the start while the game is still on rails before moving onto the sandbox gameplay. You just can't miss those things with even bare play testing. To prove my point, i wanted to visit a castle to see how it looks like so i visited Sestadeim. Guess what; Sestadeim castle exterior was EXACTLY the Lycaron City. This is just alpha material.Music is heaven. I believe it's more or less 50% of the games atmosphere.Graphics are gorgeous for a mount and blade game, ok for a 2020 release. Lighting kinda feels weird and fake, but that's just personal opinion. Generaly i'm very pleased.My advice:While it's playable, it's still very far from a steady release. If you're ok with that and you think you have the stamina to re-play the game several times untill it's ready and then some, then get it cause it's freakin awesome. It's mount and blade 2.0. But if you think you'll exhaust all your interest and you'll soon burn out before the game comes into glory, then you maybe should wait for a while and see what happens.

       " SteamReview(text=\"The game is still technically in early access, so there are a few things missing like end-game Kingdom functionality and some dialogue options for companions, but overall it's entirely playable in its current state.Coming from Warband, this game is a true successor that improves upon the previous game in several ways. Those who are fans of the previous game will find much that is familiar to them here. Proxies for different Western powers in the land of Calradia, each with their own cultures, strengths, and weaknesses, and the ability to aid or hinder them. There are some quality of life improvements as well, such as the ability to speed up map time by 2x and food not rotting. Towns and castles too feel much more fleshed out, though like in the previous games there is no real need to walk around them and you can avoid doing so the whole game given you never buy a workshop.On top of that, there are some amazing additions, most notably smithing which allows you to custom create weapons how you see fit, and some others like siege weapons. Some aspects of previous games become much more commonplace here, namely tournaments and trade. Now tournaments provide unique items in addition to the gold you bet, and trade is much easier to get involved in and serves an important part of the beginning to mid-game. All in all, much of the game has been smoothed over and polished, retaining much of the older Warband feel while still being an improvement in most areas.Last but not least, the combat. For all the improvements to the base game mentioned above, combat remains one of, if not the largest draw to the series. I have to say, they did a damn fine job at it too. The combat here is so SATISFYING. Warband was fun, and it functions much the same here, but like everything else it has been improved upon. Hits feel a lot meatier as you ride by and cleave someone in twain with a polearm from horseback, duels feel much more tense as weapon handling has been refined, and troop controls have been improved with the ability to select different formations as well as delegate troop command to the AI (sergeants). The battlefields look gorgeous, although with noticeably repeating layouts, and the large scale battles are breathtaking.A pattern is repeated here, where troop commands were present in previous games but not quite as fleshed out or as central as they are here. The only thing I miss is the ability to tell troops to advance or retreat 10 paces, as well as the fact that the AI seems to have much more fine control of the troops than I can possibly manage.All in all, the game is great so far. As a Warband junkie, it feels like much the same game, only *better in almost every way*. The economy feels more involved, game mechanics more polished, and the combat more exhilarating.

       " SteamReview(text=\"I feel like a lot of people here forget what Warband was like or how different Warband was compared to the original Mount & Blade. Warband offered some added functionality, multiplayer, and something of a narrative but was effectively the same game as the original. Even with the Diplomacy mod, the marshal AI was atrocious, marshalling fickle AI lords was even worse, and the limited amount of quests were far more than frustrating. You can't pay me enough to herd zig-zagging cattle to armies, to deliver inconsequential messages across the map, or to fight up and down 80 degree inclines ever again. Even in early-access, Bannerlord is arguably the best medieval simulator on the market, making it more than worth its value at its current price point. The influence system alone is a godsend. No more dedicated marshals and no more soliciting every peer in the realm for votes. Influence controls votes, policies, marshalling, and maintaining army cohesion. I love it. The tactical game is unreal. Gone are the days of Swadian knight charges; the game is now about holding the high ground, giving your archers a line of sight, using your cavalry to harry and flank, and maintaining infantry line discipline, especially in battles with 800+ men. The maps make combat even better. Bridges, cresting hills, narrow valleys, river crossings, rolling sand dunes, and more. Each of these terrain types demand different tactics. Fighting is a lot more fun than in Warband. Two-handed weapons are an art. The animations are satisfying to watch as well. Spear a guy from the front and he flies backwards. Shoot an arrow into a guy's neck and he grasps at it before falling to his knees, dead. Ring a guy with your glaive and he spins around in the direction you struck him. Fantastic. I don't know what all this talk about wasted hours is about. Crashes maybe? I haven't suffered a crash for about 20 hours now. It last happened when I succeeded on the first of two persuasion attempts to marry the Khergit heir. The crash occurred because I opened the dialogue box through the army panel. No big deal. I disbanded the army after I finished a siege, approached the Khergit heir afterwards, and proceeded as planned. We have a kid now and his name is Junjad, but I affectionately refer to him as Junchad. I've only encountered one or two bugs that I couldn't work around, which makes this early-access release more than playable in my eyes.  The only thing I truly dislike about Bannerlord is the defensive siege game. It needs a lot more work. Offensive sieges can be fun though, but they too need some work (e.g. laddered siege towers are useless). I suggest cracking walls with four trebuchets (after racking them up in reserve) for the best experience.Lastly, I find the emergent gameplay qualities to be superb. I've rolled two characters: first with the Battanians and now with the Khuzaits. I've adopted my own roleplay rules (over recruitment, executions, and lofty ambitions) each time and the game enables that. I once got shot off my horse and was about to be swarmed, only to command my cavalry to sweep in and save my life as if I were Jon Snow. Too much fun. I've noticed some women die from childbirth, making lords bachelors again. Feels like a real, breathing world. It'd be nice though if lords and ladies killed each other every once in a while, seeing as they breed like rabbits, but I'm sure that's to come. I've waited a long time for this game and I am beyond happy with it so far. It reminds of me of CK2 back when it was first released — a great game with the potential to become a masterpiece. Thankfully, TaleWords doesn't make any other games. This is it. With 100+ employees, the potential is there. I wouldn't hesitate to buy as a former Warband player. As a newcomer with different expectations, maybe it's worth waiting for the full release. Up to you if you want to have fun now or later.\", helpful='437 people found this review helpful, 7 people found this review funny', rewards=110, hrs_on_record=204.9),\n",
       " SteamReview(text='so after my first 144 hours in game, I have decided that the early access has a really strong foundation.The graphics are nice, combat is excellent (including horse movement and weapon use), the battles are excellent (including formations and orders), Sieges are much more improved from warband, with the addition of optional siege equipment. The towns feels alive, the factions are interesting and feel different culturally.I like the leveling up system, it feels pretty free, and not too complicated, with some nice benefits to putting time in to skills you are using in a way you enjoy the game anyway. Trading is fun, and a good way to make some cash, though the economy needs work as a whole (talked about below).I prefer the \"Sandbox Mode\" over the \"campaign mode\", as it just plonks you in the world alone, without a main story (much like Warband), though the story is fun the first time (desptire the tediousness of constantly getting repetitive quests)Your family tree, is also amazing. Getting a spouse, having children, watching them grow up, start families for themselves, eventually dying of old age and having your child take over is very immersive.Smithing needs a rework, as its really over/underpowered depending on what you are currently making. Though its necessary due to the below.While I like the Clan system over all, it needs some work mechanically, for instance, allowing lords to join you, despite their clan\\'s intentions. This could work either as the Lord forming a new clan, or they are put in a \"rogue lord\" category until they are back in the same faction as the leader of their clan.. You can\\'t make enough money naturally to achieve any of the necessary goals. Smithing cheese pretty much has to be used to balance the lack of money required for basic mechanics. This ties in to below. The way you end a war is just throwing a random lord $150k gold to stop it. No negotiations or agreements between the leaders of each faction (which is a step back for warband), OR your council can just agree to pay a daily tribute to stop the fighting (again, without agreement from the enemy you are paying tribute too). Also lords can just get auto ransomed, or escape very easily without your say or ability to stop it. This means that during a siege for example, you can defeat a lord, capture them, then have them come back with a new army during the same siege. That is a mess. You should be able to lock people up forever if you so want (or at least only have it so another lord breaks them out, or a tiny chance to escape, based on the security of the settlement).In its current state, the early game is incredible, the mid-game is fun, but the late-game only is really fun if you are a vassal. Having your own kingdom just isn\\'t fleshed out yet.I think the game could be pretty easily perfected by removing the economy aspect from the diplomacy aspect. Not having to bottleneck the game with silver, and instead having diplomacy work on merit and situation alone would improve the game tremendously.edit: spelling mistake', helpful='254 people found this review helpful, 5 people found this review funny', rewards=24, hrs_on_record=311.3),\n",
       " SteamReview(text='Warband cranked to 11. Not without it\\'s problems, crashes, and broken balance as an early access game, but even with Bannerlord mod-bombed I experience significantly less crashes and issues as of 1.2.0 personally.  TaleWorlds even borrowed some of the most popular mods made for Warband and incorporated them straight into vanilla Bannerlord. Infantry bouncing off shield walls, archers blotting out the sun with volleys of arrows, cavalry charging with spears couched headlong into the breach, and trebuchets reducing castle walls to rubble, all of which in real time with hundreds of units on screen at one time; every unit is a single entity that responds to, reacts to, and fights another unit (or you). Lines will break from morale depletion, attrition will occur if your (or other lords\\') morale is not managed. Stratagems from any of your favorite sword-and-shield RTS\\'s will translate seamlessly to the battlefield in Bannerlord; it is quite simply an RTS with your own boots on the ground (if you wish, there is also auto-resolve).Player combat is not only refreshing, but frankly fun as hell. Every aspect of combat has been improved upon from Warband, from graphic fidelity to combat mechanics to animations. Although not hyper-realistic, sword-fighting and weaponplay is addictive; you will find yourself chasing looters for days just to s***stomp them for the fun of fighting and the plunder. The UI is being worked on, but there are glaring improvements in all aspects of menu navigation from Warband. Cities, castles and fiefs now have a stylized and more aesthetically pleasing menu card, and notables have portraits at the top of the menu which allow you to teleport straight to them to eliminate manhunting important people to talk to. Troop recruitment is also much more visual and allows you to select specific units, how many units you are buying, displays your current party size, and lets you know when you are over your limit.Fully dynamic world economy with shifting supply and demand that responds directly to not only your trade, but the AI\\'s as well; becoming a medieval capitalist has never been more engaging and rewarding. Flooding a city or region with a certain good will affect it\\'s demand, supply lines can be cut if peasants are intercepted while dropping goods off in cities, caravans can be plundered en route to their destination (yes, even your own), and sieges can block cities from receiving goods; all of which potentially affecting your workshop, caravan and city revenue. Keeping the scope of the world economy in mind, the game world itself is absolutely f***ing massive. There is a ridiculous amount of cities, fiefs, and castles to visit, plunder, or do trade with, all of which operated under the guiding hand of their respective owners. Kingdoms span for miles upon miles, maintaining their borders while wrestling for control with each other; there are PLENTY of kingdoms, all of which moving gold and waging war dynamically with each other constantly. And within these kingdoms, smaller bands of warriors reside; small, fiefless clans wander their territories and can be fought or brought into your eventual kingdom. Even still, bandits and looters scurry from treeline to treeline and along the foothills of mountains to stash their plunder at their (raidable) hideouts. Peasants and caravans make haste for their destinations to keep the gears of the economy grinding. The game world feels alive and organic at all times, a mark plenty of games miss. Maintaining relationships within the realms is important, because as is clear from the above you will be the smallest fish in the pond for a good length of time. There is a much heavier emphasis on relationships now, much more than Warband. Some people won\\'t even talk to you, or will not allow you to accept quests if you are not on good terms with them. The amount of troops you can recruit from notables is also affected by relationships, and they will even deny you troops if you are not on good standings. Fief and city management is much more hands on, as there is plenty to build and improve within them. The management is accompanied by UI elements that help you visualize what you are building and will allow you to mouse over them to reveal what exactly each building does. Siege oriented buildings add depth to castle and city defense, allowing you higher garrisons, more militia, and increased siege build speed. Solid usage-based skill system (think Skyrim) that builds organically through gameplay relevant to applicable skills (ride your horse to level up your riding skill, etc.); no \"dumping points into skills after reaching another level just so you can (eventually) play how you want\" type of progression. You are not Dovahkiin, or some imperative prophet to the balance of the universe. You start exactly as any lowly sword-for-hire would in the Medieval period; with a few weapons relevant to your character\\'s starting skills, horse, the clothes on your back, a small coin purse and no clout whatsoever. People will only know your name once you begin making ripples within the realms of the world or once you begin collecting battle scars; lords will politely state they have no idea who the f*** you are if they have never heard of you.Although official tools unfortunately have not been released to the public just yet, the extensive modding support stitched into the game offers far more than Warband could; TaleWorlds really listened, as the game was built from the ground up to be modded to High Hell. Planned mods in development range from GOT mods to LOTR mods (Warhammer 40k/Fantasy mods please and thank you?). A lot of the true potential for this game lies in the modding support and community; the game is already great out of the box. Everything in the game is value based, which insures you are on the same playing field as other lords within the game, for the most part. For instance with modding, you cannot mod one aspect of the game simply for your own benefit; if you raise the general income of cities with tweaks, AI will reap the benefits just as you will.This game is early access, and many of the systems within the game are planned to be even more fleshed out. More systems are planned to be added into vanilla entirely. There truly is no comparison within the medieval sandbox genre; the size, scale, fun-factor, and sheer addictiveness of this game dwarfs any other title within the genre. This game is one of the few true sandbox experiences on the Steam store and should not be overlooked merely because of the Early Access label.', helpful='454 people found this review helpful, 16 people found this review funny', rewards=1, hrs_on_record=165.4),\n",
       " SteamReview(text='+Already playable despite Early Access+Fun combat+Decent Graphics+Good foundation in place-Missing some key features from prev games-Not quite polished yetOpen-ended gameplay is where Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord, or any Mount & Blade really, shines the most. You start off with customizing your main character, choosing his background or origins from a multitude of different ways. Did he come from a poor, middle class or noble family? Was he a known troublemaker, good samaritan or just a smart scholar? There are tons of options of customizing your character background, and he also gets his starting skills from these.Aside from the starting quest to get you up and running, the game just tosses you out on the open. What to do next depending on your own, no main quest lines. Be a merchant, trader, mercenary, bandit, lord, soldier, even founding your own kingdom is possible. I haven’t got to it yet but I’ve read that if your character dies, you can choose your heir and that heir will continue the story and be your new character. I wish more games had this neat feature.With everything being bigger than ever; the towns, castles, NPCs, as well as the improved UI, the game feels more like a proper RPG now. I’m getting Witcher 3 vibes from this game especially when roaming around in towns or villages riding a horse. Unlike a lot of sequels that try hard to change the formula or revolutionize the series only to fail, Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord does quite the opposite and perfectly embodies the proverb mentioned above. It religiously follows the blueprint for what constitutes a Mount & Blade game, which is a great thing.For all intents and purposes, Bannerlord is basically just a remastered Mount & Blade: Warband just with a new expansion providing the new features. And this was just exactly what the people wanted. Even Bannerlord in very low graphics looks very close visually to Warband. That being said, I will try to review it as its own game with only minimal comparison to Warband. The graphics are decent. It surprised me how a game that was at one point planned for a 2016 release still comes with visuals that is passable for today\\'s (2020) standards. Props for the effort to upgrade the graphics throughout the years. Granted it isn\\'t the best looking game I\\'ve seen. Still, the game is an epic battle moment screenshot goldmine. I wish they could include Ansel support in the future. There are lots of weapons in Bannerlord: Bows, Crossbows, Spears, Maces, Axes, Swords, Shields of all types, and many more. There is also a weapon crafting system, a new addition to the series. Besides traditional foot combat, horseback combat is also available and a huge part of the game. There are different theatres for warfare present throughout: An open area of various terrains from dense forests, rugged hills, watery riverside, to huge open fields. Or through the different villages or castles in the world map, should you attack or defend them.Combat is fun, as expected for the series. Indeed one of the strongest points of the game. Swinging your weapon, blocking and parrying attacks, hitting and killing enemies all feels very gratifying. The AI is harder now and that’s a good thing. Compared to Warband’s buttery smooth combat and animations, Bannerlord’s take is much more gritty and realistic. Swings and animations have more weight to it. Weapons have far larger differences now in terms of speed and reach. They react more realistically when hitting objects. Unfortunately this results in huge balance issues for the game that they need to sort out. The game maxes out at 1000 units, meaning you can have 500 vs 500 battles which is a huge amount of NPCs fighting. It really feels immersive going into battle and gives me that Lord of the Rings vibes. (can’t wait to play LOTR mods in the future!)One major key feature that I’ve found missing is the auto-block option for at least the singleplayer. This was actually the default option for the previous games so naturally a lot of old timers are requesting it back. For now, all players are stuck with the competitive style directional blocking. This makes non-shield type melee combat inaccessible for a huge amount of players. At the same time this makes shield or ranged combat the unquestionable superior types of combat.In my opinion, Bannerlord really needs the early access treatment, for better or for worse. With the first game being one of the first titles to go on early access before it was even called early access, having the second game follow a similar direction is just fitting. For a game with such scope and ambition, it is more effective to tap into the playerbase; old and newcomers alike, before going on full release. Thousands of players playtesting the game is much better than having an internal or limited access playtesting only. Sure, they could have gone instead with a free beta access and offered a pre-order option only for those willing to pay. But it’s basically just Early Access in the grand scheme of things.Despite being in an already playable state, the game still needs a lot of work. Especially in the singleplayer campaign. Questlines are unfinished and lacking in content, textures missing, and maps being reused. Some features are to follow or a work in progress. Should you play this game right now, prepare to find a lot of placeholder text for basically everything. Warband actually feels more like a better and solid game right now when it comes to these aspects.The game ran passably on my setup: i7-8700k, 32GB RAM, and GTX 1080. Hovers just around 50-60 with everything maxed out and testing a 500 vs 500 NPC battle. It’s a CPU heavy game so no matter the resolution or graphics settings it still plateaus at around 50-60 FPS when the game gets very demanding. As a high refresh rate user, it’s a bit disappointing. But this is one of the rare cases where I would trade my precious 100+ FPS for 50+ FPS just to experience huge epic battles. I\\'ve only encountered one graphical bug so far. During battle, some parts of the screen bugged and turned into black squares. I couldn\\'t see 80% of what\\'s happening. I reloaded my save and so far it never came back. Despite all the current issues, it’s still a yes for me. Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord already has all the hallmarks of a future great open-ended sandbox game. The foundation is already in place, it just needs that extra time in early access to tie up all the loose ends. If you want a fully polished solid experience at your first playthrough, I would suggest waiting it out.

       " SteamReview(text=\"If you're deciding whether you should wait to buy the game, or go for it now it all comes down to how much perfection you expect from a game in early access.All issues I have experienced are minor, there have been no crashes, or major gameplay issues.

Minor other issues, such as starting battles in first person and seeing the backs of your eyes/eyebrows are the greatest problems I've encountered. Those are solved by switching from first to third, then back to first person so it's not the end of the world by any stretch of the imagination. If minor graphical issues are a dealbreaker for you, save your money until a few updates come out and maybe invest it in some chill pills in the meantime.

       " SteamReview(text=\"1100 hours in annnd...The game is fun, no doubt about it, but for the most part it's a prettier Warband.  Without mods the game is pretty barebones in content.  The game is not hard.  Once you've hit lvl 30+ a few times you can steamroll the game.  If you are going to make you own kingdom, in order to recruit other lords you will have to chase them down to give gifts or release them after battle to get your rep with them high to recruit them.If you have multiple towns the rep notifications from the Governor with the merchants of the town is non-stop.  Each notification has a sound.  In my current playthrough I get so many that they actually queue and lag behind.With the Perk system, some are useful.  Overall most are worthless.  This is due to the fact that each perk has a role.  Like, Personal, Captain, Governor, Party Leader.  Governor perks are worthless to player.  Players can't be governors.  Others are role specific Surgeon, Scout, Engineer, Quartermaster.Companions are essentially non developmental.  Scouts will increase their Scout skill.  Surgeons just stop at 160ish.  Engineers won't go higher than 100ish.  They learn other skills at an abysmal rate therefore they barely level.  Maybe 2 levels if you're lucky.Sieges are plagued by the AI and player controlled soldiers not using ladders, siege towers and engines in a reasonable fashion.  If there are 2 ladders to one side to scale a wall, only one will be used.  Some siege towers have 3 ladders.  Typically 1 is used normally but you might see 2 every so often.  Very rarely 3.Now what I consider to be the absolute best part of the game.  You will spend 90% of your time on the campaign map.  Moving around fight, recruit, siege, defend, etc.  You will do this all at a whopping 6-12 frames per second.  The menus load slowly.  The last 3 to 4 patches have dramatically reduced the campaign map performance to a level that is 1 more headache away from never playing again.  Battles are just fine and have normal FPS.  Taleworlds is indicating this might, could possible be a bug and have no ETA on a fix or if there will be a fix.  With release happening this year.The very fundamental basics of a good game are there.  Taleworlds just hasn't done anything with them.  They also haven't appeared to want to do anything with them either.  Rumor is they've moved on to another game or are working on DLC leaving this one to wallow in the depths of slow development.Would I recommend this game?  If you like M&B and have the cash then have at it.

This battle awoke a bloodlust in Orestes that he could not control.Looking south Orestes invaded the lands of the sand people and defeated a small army. Its general by chance, the very Sultan of the sand people was taken to Orestes, who had him decapitated. There would be no quarter to the barbarian pagans of the deserts. What ensued was an absolute bloodbath, over 30 nobles slain in guerrilla warfare, scorched earth tactics. Towns all over surrendered their meager #3 quantities of cheese and butter, and also their hobbled weapons and tools. The campaign would soon deplete Orestes saved up fortune and he was forced to turn back to Ortysia. There he discovered his new passion as a salesman of the finest boots and headwraps. But this was not enough, curious one day Orestes visited his local smith and forged his first sword. In the span of a few weeks Orestes would forge so many weapons as to rival Hephaestus himself. His swords soon sky rocketed in value and he was able to bankrupt the entire city's economy with the sale of a single one of his Signature Two-Handed Polearms, titled: Mars.Orestes would then take up arms again. This time acquiring the Dragon Banner of Calradia and claiming rightful fief of all of Calradia. Barbarians would no longer sate his blood lust.

All would fall to Orestes with the clairvoyant power of the F5 quicksave. His kill count would rise each battle, until night before the siege, Orestes himself killed over 100 men in single combat after the garrisoned had sallied forth from their gates. It would be after this that Orestes made peace with the Empire, went back to Ortysia and crafted 30 divinely infused and crafted polearms, each worth 40k and donated them to the towns under his fief. Within 3 weeks he was churning a profit that fuel his further expansion into Thoracte Castle, Tubulis Castle, Sargot, Quyaz and now Ortysia itself.Now Orestes raids the wastelands of the desert, slaying man and woman alike.

I know that's a strange predicament for someone with 265 hours on record at time of this review, but let me explain;This game is great, there is a lot to it and the files can be edited to make the game align more to your taste.However, the AI is bad.And I mean BAD.On campaign, I've joined an army which gathered at a village which was very close to a friendly castle which was being besieged. Our army was larger than the besieging force, but the army leader decided to ignore that and head North to almost the other side of the map to raid a village.In battle, the army I was in advanced toward a Battanian army which positioned itself quite cleverly at the top of a steep hill. Our army stopped and stood at the bottom just taking ranged attacks, they finally walked half way up the hill, but then turned around, presented their BACKS to the ranged enemy and walked back down. They did this about 4 times before finally charging up the hill. The battle was won, but there were so many avoidable casualties taken.In siege, the AI doesn't understand ladders. when they lift the siege ladders, they only use one of the two if they use them at all. Sometimes they just stand at the base of the ladders and do nothing. The AI is slightly better with Siege towers, though with laddered siege towers, the defenders have a habit of climbing down the ladders and literally start fighting on them, until one of the attacking artillery pieces destroys its own siege tower.These are just single experiences I've had from an absolute ton of them, but I will still recommend this game, there is still so much on offer, and it's early access, so there is still time for these AI problems to be addressed.\", helpful='138 people found this review helpful, 11 people found this review funny', rewards=4, hrs_on_record=290.4),\n",

Huge respect to the devs for actually listening to the community. It's a good time to get it.PAST REVIEW8 long years and this is what we get. It's not really a huge leap when compared to its predecessor. In terms of graphical fidelity sure but veteran warband players will still experience more of the same thing and much of the dialogue is a copypaste from the previous title. Speaking of voice acting, there is hardly any. While the architecture is now more grand and detailed, players will still have no reason to explore different parts of a city and fast travelling can be done via TAB menu. There are tons of things that are completely incoherent to the setting. The villages as described by the game to be rich and flourishing are empty. In fact, it doesn't matter how prosperous it is, you will still see the same farmers working the fields. They should add more villagers each with their own things to say to make the environment believable. Castles have few guards without any noble residing in it In character customization, you can't select presets. You can't sculpt your character's face according to race/faction. The quests from the previous title are petty chores and they're imported into this game as well. New merchant quests in particular are non-sensical and pointless. I'm sure a lot of players would appreciate if the devs could create a more story driven campaign with voice acting in addition to its already solid sandbox foundation. Court advisors and viziers should be the intermediary during dialogue to show that a king isn't simply some peasant you can talk to. An audience granted by a king or sultan must be sought, earned and being in their presence should be an honour. Being knighted and swearing allegiance to them, a prestigious moment to elevate a sense of purpose for the player. Even more so to imagine what it would be like for the player to be sitting on that very throne. Medieval nobility here are puppets to be exploited. Instead why not give them their own unique personalities with their actions and yours affecting political climate and change of attitude among them. NPCs are just programmed to war with each other with no proper implementation of diplomacy. If the player eventually rules a faction, why can't the ruler send an emissary to a neighboring kingdom to open up favorable diplomatic options. Why would there be a feature to dress casually if it didn't affect your status or charm. There should be different and interesting dialogue options when speaking to NPCs. Female players should be able to curtsy and dance in accordance to the faction's culture. What's a medieval age without upheavals? There should be demagogue usurpers from a starving populace hellbent on overthrowing a crazy monarch. These are examples of how you add depth to a sandbox game. Despite all this, I can still recommend it to players who have never played mount and blade. This is simply an upgraded version of the previous title with a simple economic system, political system based on influence, tournaments and the new blacksmithing feature. The battles are still epic as ever with a plethora of medieval weapons, armor, accessories and horses for yourself and your companions. As for me, I'm going to wait for for the devs to actually make use of the financial support they're getting and release a major update worth playing.\", helpful='637 people found this review helpful, 27 people found this review funny', rewards=100, hrs_on_record=28.9),\n",

I commanded armys to raid castles in bloody, close, combat battles and when I win I can't help but to feel like a badass. Just the title screen and music do it for me. for that reason I overlook the flaws. This game is jam packed with stuff but often feels repetitive. The story isn't the greatest, but the game litterally drops you in and you basically conquer the world the way you want. Be a warlord or a merchant, side with person A or person B, you have options.

       " SteamReview(text=\"I would first recommend this game to the players who are more open world / medieval combat oriented. Games like Mordhau, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Chivalry etc.. are the reasons I fall into this category, and if you like any of those games or any similar to that. You will already like Bannerlord before you realize it. But to those who aren't familiar with M&B, a half decent summary would say it is a medieval sandbox where your goal is to be the strongest faction on the map by whatever means necessary.   TO THOSE WHO PLAYED M&B WARBAND:Many would consider this to be a continuation of this game, and I'd have to agree. It is not a bad thing because I believe there is a lot more content being added and a lot of problems that have been solved since then. Combat mechanics are the same, with some ai differences and new weapons/armor. New perk trees/concepts for you and your companions. Bannerlord also added a questline that nudges you along towards total domination, either by you or your ruler. Oh and also, when you feel like skipping the battle and just sending your troops in, they fixed the chance system for how likely characters are to die. So rest assured you don't have to worry about one sea raider killing multiple of your hundreds of troops What I found to be the strongest points that make this game shine:-A free roam concept where you do as you please. You can serve/fight for whatever faction you wish, including your own. You can interact with characters  and so on.-You are able to participate in open battles with hundreds of units on the field, commanding different types of troops to do different actions(face a certain direction, make a formation, hold fire, follow you) and many others, or if you're a part of an army filled with other nobles, then you lead one type of troop (infantry, arrows, cavalry, horse archers) under your commander. Regardless you are going to take a step back when you first see dozens of cavalry rolling over the hills in the distance, or when your commander gives the order to charge and you have to join the front line where chaos is the only thing that is happening. -Siege events with a lot of potential for strategy, I say potential because if you decide not to set them on auto the troops are only as effective as you are at commanding them, but as far as content there is a lot going on. Between manning a catapult to try and take out their siege tower, and making sure that the troops are holding the line at the main gate where they've broken through. It takes a lot out of your hands as you try to make it all happen on the keyboard. and it looks really intimidating seeing hundreds moving troops outside your walls. -very smooth trading system in markets and with npc's (it's still in EA so frame rate drops, load screens still happen but that is something that will be smoothed out) -music music music, I love the MUSIC! Consistently M&B proves that not all gaming companies are giving up on going above and beyond for their soundtracks. The only negatives I have for this one is that there isn't enough of it and I wasn't there in person to hear it being performed. Sadly I found some things to be negative points about the game. This is kind of difficult to tell since it is in EA, so things may be added/changed/fixed after this post so I will focus on content that is there now rather than bugs and whatnot. -AI isn't the smartest, if you're not the commander and you are only in charge of one troop. Then they go on to do whatever they want to, and it may not match up with what is considered the best strategy. At the beginning of each battle you spawn on opposite sides of the map. One battle my commander thought it best to go backwards and to the left up a hill with a bunch of trees. Pushing the boundary of the map, I had to figure out where I was going to put 200+ archers so that they could see and fire at the enemy. -You only know as much as you research. What I mean by this is that the only tutorial you get is the combat and how to use different weapons/shields. Arguably this isn't a negative, but I deem it more negative than not because there are a few menu/keyboard tips that would help to know early on. As silly as it sounds, I spent more time than I should have looking in the vendors inventory for food because I didn't know that the category filters were at the top of the screen. Or how I wanted to look characters/locations up to know what faction they were a part of, or to find them but couldn't until I accidentally pressed n and opened the encyclopedia. They have already added a mechanic that lets you click rmb to open the encyclopedia on a certain items but that doesn't solve the entire issue of the average player being clueless. Right now when you press esc in game there is a list of tips you can look through on the left which is a plus, but I hope they add more because it doesn't solve as many questions as it could. All in all the game is great and any of the negatives I've found don't outweigh the positives. If you were sold on the game after a few points then you're going to love it regardless of whatever you dislike about the game. I bought it not only because it appeals to what I like in a game, but also because I believe TaleWorlds is capable of reminding players what their standards should be for a great game.

       " SteamReview(text='As someone who followed this project very closely on the official forums I have to say that TaleWorlds is an absolute garbage at their job. They are sidelining the community at every opportunity. They have a track record of hindering any and all attempts of their modding community at fixing their broken game and have shown actual jealousy over the work of their modding scene.Almost two years ago TW proclaimed that custom, moddable servers can\\'t be made now, but they\\'ll be a thing in 2022, which prompted the modding community to making their own custom servers in few days of work, all by adding few lines of code. TW of course threw a hissy fit over it and patched it out, but it at least shown us how incompetent they are at their own jobs.\"It\\'s early access, you have to lower your expectations\" - My expectations are so low that I had to dig a hole for them to lay in.This game should have never been released in Early Access. You need tons of mods to make it actually feel alive and fun, something which TW is actively hindering by throwing tantrums at all Total Conversion modders, because once again - players can do a better job than the actual devs.This whole development process is a farce from start to finish. I honestly hope that when they (maybe) eventually release their 1.6, they\\'ll adress all these issues and stop sidelining players with corpo-talk and tantrums. But it\\'s TaleWorlds, so the reality is that they\\'re probably limiting our possibilities to milk us on future in-game-transactions and mediocre DLCs.I wish we got the same treatment Warband did with Viking Conquest, which was a joined project of both the developers and the community.Forums topics I\\'m referring to in the review are \\'An open letter from the Kingdoms of Arda team, and the total-conversion mod community\\' and \\'Multiplayer mods can\\'t be made until 2022 unless we find an alternative\\', but there are literal hundreds other posts and topics there that show how out of touch and jaded the devs are.

       " SteamReview(text='A worthy successor to Warband, but it still needs more time in the oven. Mods fix some of the bigger issues. I\\'d rank it as a must-play if you were a WB fan or if you\\'ve ever wanted to play a Total War game as a 3rd person RPG of sorts.Pros:+ Looks good. Many times, even better than the screenshots on the Steam store.+ Moddable.+ Gorgeous soundtrack.+ The core gameplay loop is awesome. It feels good to go from zero to hero. You eventually find a favorite weapon that suits your play style and smithing can let you obtain an even better version of it.+ Battles no longer end when you die, and you can fast-forward the remainder of the battle, which is very nice.+ A lot of the crashes that made the game almost unplayable near release have been fixed. In 1.6.2 I got about one crash every 3-4 hours, and that\\'s while running 10+ mods, which is pretty good in my book - just save often.Cons:- The first and biggest issue is the way experience works. Because new levels ask for exponential increases in skill levels while decreasing your learning rate, reaching mastery in any skill takes an incredible amount of time. I get that, realistically, you could only hope to master one, maybe two things during a lifetime, and the game wants to lean towards realism. I just wish the game also offered you the choice between realistic and \"power fantasy\" when it comes to skill leveling, because the game is a lot more fun when you can personally take out 30-50 enemies before formation combat even begins.As of 1.6.2, you can address this by using the Leveling Rebalance mod, possibly in combination with the Kaoses tweaks mod. Unfortunately, mods frequently break during new updates, so this will be a recurring issue.- Endgame kingdom management should have some auto-resolve options, such as \"give fief to noble with most council support / highest relation / lowest relation\".- There should be a way to contact lords without having to find them on the other side of the map. Couriers and emissaries would be a way. You should also be able to talk with them while they\\'re in jail, at least if it\\'s your jail.- The AI could use improvements. Riders still frequently crash into trees, ladders are sometimes ignored during sieges, cavalry attached to infantry formations will ride ahead to their death instead of staying close. Archers in the same formation will prefer forming one vulnerable long line, unflinching even when clearly being overrun by cavalry/infantry, instead of splitting up and moving around during AI control - which I imagine is a limitation of the formations system - but I wish the AI itself could handle smarter splitting of troops. Enemies will constantly stream at you when respawning instead of trying to regroup and have a sizable force for a new wave, though your troops are guilty of doing the same. Also, during sieges, one unit will sometimes get stuck and you can\\'t end the battle without exiting the map and restarting it.Still, it is generally competent enough to make the gameplay fun, I just feel like it\\'s a few steps away from being truly great. I hope to one day come back to it and replay it as an RTS where I dodge the occasional arrow, with troop command being a fully viable play style.Overall rating: 8 out of 10 Swadian butter caravans. Some changes to the way you gain experience and how the AI handles itself, as well as further improving on game stability would bring it over the finish line, and all of these seem doable with time.', helpful='83 people found this review helpful, 2 people found this review funny', rewards=5, hrs_on_record=105.1),\n",
       " SteamReview(text='TL;DRFor any fan of the Mount & Blade series, Bannerlord is an easy choice:  Yes, get it!  It\\'s worth the price even in Early Access.  I\\'ve played Bannerlord from day one and can honestly say the current game has drastically improved since the public release.Essentially, the player starts as a skill-less, worthless, unknown peasant and begins earning his/her salt by fighting up through the ranks.  Exactly what you do is your choice:  Become the right-hand man of a King/Queen or develop your own kingdom.  Stay independent and deal in trade as a merchant.  Rogue it up by ransacking villages, traveling civilians and caravans.  Be honorable or a miscreant.  There\\'s no linear path but choices have consequences, good and bad.The start can be rough and a bit of a grind, but once you\\'ve saved enough money to hire some troops, purchased a few shops, hired some caravans and made some noble friends, then the game really takes off.Key highlights:Pros+ Open World, Sandbox+ Combat is mostly fluid and satisfying.  Certainly not a combat simulator, but requires just enough \\'skill\\' to be more than a simple button-smasher.+ First person perspective combat; and 3rd person for you weirdos out there :P + No specified roles.  Fight on foot or horse.  Fight with sword, ax, pole-arm, bow & arrow, etc.  Heavy armor, light armor or no armor?  Shield or no shield - that is the question!+ Progression.  There is a noticeable difference in combat as your character improves as well as your \"companions\" (NPC\\'s whom follow the player).+ Skill Tree.  A wide variety of skills that definitely impact game play.  + Inventory Management. BIG improvement over previous titles. + Family system.  Can marry and have children.  Children become heirs so the player can continue playing once the original character dies from old age.+ Companions.  Various NPCs have unique skills.  Use them to your advantage (warrior, trader, engineer, surgeon and more).+ Town & Castle Management.  Can build improvements to fiefs that impact security, garrison, income, growth and a few others.  Pretty basic.  Improved over previous titles but needs love.  See Neutral for more info. + Gangs.  Every town has a gang that may or may not own a shop.  Can clear them out of towns (temporarily) to gain favor of from merchants or other gang leaders.  Impacts your reputation and relationships.  I believe future updates will incorporate more uses for them.+ Shops.  Can purchase shops in town as an easy way to earn extra money.  Read a guide on how they work.  Not much to them but some things aren\\'t apparent.+ Graphics are nice.  Nothing next-gen but still eye pleasing.+ Developers - they continuously add updates and meaningful changes.  Yes, there have been a few broken patches, but it doesn\\'t take long before they\\'re corrected.+ Hundreds and hundreds of hours of game play.  I\\'m not even sure if there is an \"end\" unless the character dies with no heirs?Neutral-+ Story-line - it\\'s just \\'Meh\\'.  Regardless, it has been improved and expanded.-+ Equipment (weapons, armor, etc.)  There is already an impressive amount of gear, but I do hope they add more, especially for armors and cosmetics (civilian clothing).-+ Town/Castle Management.  Simply needs more depth and complexity - a bit too basic as is but not enough to warrant a \"con\".Cons- Hit registry.  Usually good, but will definitely experience instances when the player\\'s weapon passes through enemy with no damage.  - AI.  Friendly AI love to block your attack, your path and overall be a nuisance.  Common to have nearby friendlies block your attack on enemy, while enemy AI happily ignore the shields of friendly AI.  It\\'s just aggravating and weird.- AI pathing.  Has been improved but still an issue.  AI don\\'t always climb ladders or siege towers, but rather stand at the bottom while arrows rain down from above.  Perhaps they drank too much mead before battle?  (Helpful tip:  sometimes the problem is one moron blocking the ladder.  An arrow to this guy\\'s face may unscrew the screw up.)- Lighting.  Some objects, like plants/bushes and rocks, bleed light (casts a glow around or under them).  Some flickering issues in certain areas.  When characters or horses run, they kick up large clouds of dust and it\\'s very reflective.  All minor issues.- PC requirements.  You\\'ll want a fairly beefy system to enjoy large battles and high graphics but a mid-range setup and lowered settings can play adequately.  My settings & PC setup @ end.Areas to Improve:- Hit registry needs love.  It\\'s not horrible, but can be very aggravating at times during critical moments.- Barter screen.  The slider scale is too sensitive when trying to adjust large amounts of items or currency.  Also, the mouse delay for holding left-click is way too long before items increase or decrease.- Some areas in towns or battles have light flickering or light bleed (under rocks/plants) during certain times of day.Playing at 2560x1440 on mostly high settings, averaging 100-120 frames during battles.9900K @ 5.2 Ghz32 GB DDR4 @ 3200 MHz (CL 14)2070 Super (OC)Installed on SSD', helpful='150 people found this review helpful, 4 people found this review funny', rewards=21, hrs_on_record=957.2),\n",

(sourcing themselves: . How come?

Fief options are very limited. Marrying has little use besides getting a free companion, selecting a bride for your brother is literally useless.This game as of December 2021 feels okeish but still a shell, unfinished product, and if you watch the pace at which they've been adding patches and specially, at the scarce amount of contents within these patches, you already know this game will not be finished for June 2022.

The devs have also alienated all of the major players in the modding community (which is what is currently keeping the game alive) by ignoring their pleas for better communication on up-coming fixes and not listening to their suggested (simple) fixes for alot of the larger issues plaguing the game.

I bought the game on launch, and honestly I was pretty unimpressed and decided I\\'d wait a while then come back to see how things were going. With that out of the way, here\\'s some of my thoughts on where it\\'s at right now:I cannot recommend anyone to buy this game in good conscious unless you genuinely don\\'t care about value for money. The game is still M&B, if you loved Warband, you will enjoy this game. The problem is that there\\'s nothing at all beneath the surface gameplay. The choices you make and the people you befriend or make enemies of simply do not matter at all. The game outside of combat feels extremely lifeless. Every NPC says the same 2 or 3 lines. Your dialogue choices don\\'t actually matter either. Companions have less depth than Warband, and spouses might as well just be your acquaintance that occasionally carries your child. Towns and villages are absolutely dead as well. Taverns are especially funny, with musicians consistently playing invisible lutes and maidens pouring ale until the end of time. Don\\'t get me wrong, the gameplay is obviously the major selling point, but at $50 I was hoping for a world that\\'s at least more interactive than Warband\\'s, not somehow less.The AI is incredibly easy to manipulate and often quite stupid. You can stop any siege in it\\'s tracks by starting a siege on something of theirs close by. There\\'s almost no semblance of actual strategy for your allies or enemies in battles as well. 99% of large battles have one or both sides forming an infantry circle around their archers and letting the cavalry fight among themselves. You haven\\'t experienced true hell until you get knocked out in the arena and all that\\'s left is two horse archers circling each other for 20 minutes, missing every single arrow until they finally have to pull out their swords. That\\'s not to say the combat isn\\'t fun, but it\\'s certainly not polished at all.My final reason for not recommending this game comes when you look at the patch notes. It\\'s all crash fixes. There\\'s some new singleplayer content, some future plans. That\\'s all well and good, but scroll through all the patch notes, and 90% of them are fixing crashes that seemingly occur for every interaction in the game. I\\'m not implying they shouldn\\'t be fixing crashes, but rather pointing out a worrying trend. This game has been in development hell since it\\'s announcement, and I doubt it\\'s coming out of early access any time soon. I want to see this title and TW reach their full potential so badly, but I\\'m also a realist. This game still has YEARS to go before I\\'d wager I\\'ll be able to proudly proclaim \"this product is worth $50 USD +tax\". I will be ecstatic the day I can come back to this review and update it, but for now it\\'s a no from me.', helpful='175 people found this review helpful, 4 people found this review funny', rewards=19, hrs_on_record=67.1),\n",

This affects accessibility of a game feature and hence is a relevant buy consideration.TW has made some claims to invistigate it, but so far without any further results. TW mods here on steam forums have just purged a thread (instead of at least locking it with a comment why) which called for attention regarding this censorship. Note also, the discussion there was surprisingly calm without getting overboard. I am glad to remove/change the review when this issue is settled the only possible correct way.*update 03.11.2021*Since this review, the only thing about it I can find is claim by TW that they are going to investigate it, but no further updates since, even if I employ a search on that topic again. I find stale \"updates\" like this one: Regarding the game itself:The skill leveling system is a pure grind. For some very annoying skills there is a cheese workaround in some way which is totally unimmersive, like for example to train roguary fast, you need to stage prison escapes for others over and over again. People you don\\'t care about and don\\'t know. Just to get the XP... Most ways of doing XP gives no xp. You can also not train fighting skills in tournaments and arena, because its reduced to almost zero. TW thinks there is only one way to play the game - as a vassal or soldier of another kingdom. Complete breakage compared to warband. Then there are skills like smithing, which are tedious and boring, the UI is terrible, but: you can craft items for the cheapest resources worth around 200 gold and sell them for around 90.000 gold at very low levels which you get to very fast.You go trade with a noble one, sell him 5 swords for all the fortune he owns and they are happy to sign the deal. Then they are in dire need of money and sell all their land for gold worth selling 9 swords...If you think its a bug, no. Its like that since the beginning and its not just one specific item. The prices for items are crazy. One sword costs 5k, another one has 1 more damage and consts 30k or 50k.With smithing you basically have infinite money EASY and FAST. You can buy all the realm and the nobles will happily sell it to you. No army needed, Just craft some ~60-90 weapons!I have no clue what the devs took to make that real and keep it like that with no changes.', helpful='1,782 people found this review helpful, 118 people found this review funny', rewards=5, hrs_on_record=228.2),\n",

       " SteamReview(text='TL;DR/ConclusionThis game is a jarring, overambitious mess, but watching your character grow from a baby into a unique leader, watching your army grow from a band of young recruits into unique and devastating fighting force that would make any man in its way pray, watching your friends and foes form and the world around you change because of it... are things I would say only this game has been able to give me, no other.As with many early access games, my relationship with this game is one of love and hate.So much of this game is stuff I\\'ve always wanted in games like this and haven\\'t seen done well pretty much anywhere else:- Smaller scale unit tactics with more focus on the individual and the feeling of actually being there in a medieval battle- Simulated and dynamic systems like economy, logistics, morale, intuitive unit progression, even combat physics to calculate how much damage is being done by a particular weapon at a particular speed with a particular type of strike through a particular armour- RPG style skills with really creative perks and progression that very subtly and effectively makes you feel like you and your character are improving together.- Etc.Now all of the things I just mentioned, I would say put this game above many other strategy and battle sim games because they are things which increase immersion, they help put you in the shoes of your character and feel like you\\'re playing in a living, breathing world. The strength of this game is its depth and immersion.If any of you reading this have played this game at all, you\\'ve probably noticed something very wrong with that statement.This game will CONSTANTLY rip you right out of your \\'immersion\\' and make you very consciously aware that you\\'re playing a video game:- The combat physics don\\'t make any sense half the time (there\\'s been an up to date \\'Realistic Battle\\' mod on the nexus for the majority of this game\\'s existence which fixes these issues, making combat far more satisfying and I\\'m shocked the devs still haven\\'t addressed this).- Walking around towns and villages (which should be where immersion really shines) feels like you\\'re walking through a ghost town, with statue npcs with terrifying expressions who don\\'t say anything and a \\'town_ambience.mp3\\' being played through hidden speakers in the facade houses. - Dialogue between characters may as well be non existent, with visual novel text boxes with bland writing and the most nonsensical dialogue skill checks I\\'ve possibly ever seen.- The repetitive, monotonous nature of putting your men into the same positions and the same formations at the start of every battle every 5 minutes.These things are scratching the surface of the list of things that give constant immersive whiplash while playing this game.I understand these things can come with early access titles but with this game supposedly leaving early access this year, I don\\'t see enough of these issues being addressed, and I\\'m concerned that TW is running out of time and/or budget. I\\'m not acutely aware of how game development works but I\\'m slightly baffled that they seem to come out with new armours every patch, when more items is the last thing the game needs right now. I worry the loud minority of the Reddit page etc. are giving the devs a false image of what players care about. I couldn\\'t care less if imperial armour is \"unbalanced\" or if the \\'long glaive\\' is \"overpowered\" during game release when every npc I look at makes me feel like I\\'m playing a parody. Maybe I\\'m in the minority too but to me it really feels like the devs have their priorities mixed up and that this game will remain very much unfinished during it\\'s 1.0 release, which is a real shame considering how much I love the unique feeling this game can give me in its strongest moments.The concept is so brilliant but as much as I want it to, I just don\\'t think this game will ever reach its full potential.That being said, I will continue to love this game and try to contribute feedback where I can for likely years to come, and will recommend it for its strengths nonetheless.', helpful='94 people found this review helpful, 1 person found this review funny', rewards=7, hrs_on_record=467.5),\n",

       " SteamReview(text=\"An absolutely awesome game that's highly engrossing and a lot of fun ^^ However, at the time of writing this, the game is very early access. Due to the popularity of the previous game and the demand for this game, they may have released it a lot earlier than most people would have liked. Although the devs seem to listen to suggestions, and are steadily improving a lot of aspects with regular updates, which may make the game better than if they waited until it was more finished before releasing it :)Single player is so much fun with so many different ways to play it.Become a merchant, a mercenary, a smuggler, a blacksmith, a lord/lady or even a King or Queen of a Kingdom. You can also lead or fight in armies/sieges, manage castles and cities, get married, have kids. There are 6 races you can play as with different perks, you can customise your male or female character then chose what life they had which affect your starting out skill levels.There are different difficulty levels. If you haven't played the previous game, I recommend starting out on very easy then when you get the hang of it, go to realistic. You also can't play this like the previous game, seen people who tried with hilarious results. One Warband player went charging into some cavalry, was killed in one hit and his dead body rag dolled off his horses xD Like in Kingdom Come Deliverance, you start the game off as a peasant and feel like a peasant.You also have an option to have lords perma die or not die. There are pros and cons to having it on or off. If it is on and you die in battle, like with the npc lords and ladies, there's a chance you be captured and a chance you will stay dead. If you do die and you have married and had a child, then you can carry on playing as as the child. (Currently a child takes 1,512 days to grow up to an 18 year old. A day not sped up takes 1 min 36 secs but if quickly waiting a day will take 10 seconds. There's 4 months in a year. So a child will take between 40.32 hrs to 4.2 hrs real time to grow up atm/time of posting this.)When you start the game you create a clan which is your family and any one you have hired. When you get your clan level high enough, you can create your own kingdom (if you haven't joined an npc kingdom). Then you are essentially a King or Queen and can persuade/charm enemy clan leaders into becoming your vassals. Unless you have a dynasty of grown up children, you need vassals if you strive for world domination. Also with other lords/ladies you can use influence to create armies and have huge battles. Huge battles are fun, feels a bit like a Total war game but played from a first person perspective as a peasant/mercenary, lord or general.Multiplayer is fun but the vast majority of the people in it have possibly played the game for hundreds of hours. In multiplayer there is a captain mode where you strategically command troops and there is a 60 vs 60 siege battle of only real life players which is awesome. 60 vs 60 siege is so cool, you have real life players pushing the rams, managing the ballistas, throwing boulders at the invading forces, sometimes you might even see players holding their shield up to protect other players on their team. While I definitely recommend the game and while it is playable, it does have a long way to go.The vast majority of the negative reviews seem to be people who haven't got a good pc or were expecting a more finished, bug free and optimised game. So I suggest you look in the discussions and news for updates before deciding when you want to buy it.Also about the multiplayer Anti cheat: The anti cheat is Battleye, I like that there's an anti cheat and that its not useless Denuvo, but I've avoided installing Battleye when playing Ark Survival Evoled. Its a highly invasive and from researching it, a minority of cases have had malicious problems since installing it. But because most players don't have a noticeable problem, people think its safe. I'm just not sure if it is actually safe (just highly invasive) or if it is smartly malicious, either way don't really want it on my computer. So will uninstall it when I'm not playing on multiplayer. Would kinda prefer For Honors/Vermintides 2's Easy Anti cheat as it's less invasive and processor hungry while being highly effective\", helpful='106 people found this review helpful, 6 people found this review funny', rewards=14, hrs_on_record=46.5),\n",

Some talents doesn\\'t work at all or not like they should, but community mods have fixed this.FPS drops drastically sometimes during big siege battles, depends on where you are and what you are looking at.When you die you can fast forward the rest of the battle, when it is a big battle and FPS drops, the seconds goes by slower sadly.A bug happened to me during a siege, there was 1 enemy that managed to bug itself high up on a wall, and none of my units were able to kill the last enemy, resulting in an endless battle, because for some reason you have to kill every single enemy to win. So we were about 40 units trying to kill the last guy, I managed to find some arrows outside the castle and kill him.Another time I died and let the battle continue to see if we won or not. But again there was an enemy that bugged itself so it turned into an endless battle. I had to select \"retreat\", lose units because we retreated, and then send in units afterwards to kill that 1 guy, and somehow manage to lose a few units again.There is also this mini-game where you have to convince someone to marry you, if you fail 1 time on any of the questions (percentage chance) then you will never ever be able to marry that one npc. You can save and load to repeat, but it becomes tedious. Maybe you can increase your standing with this NPC by doing quests or gifting stuff, but not everyone has quests available or very rarely, and gifting takes time.But I still recommend this, because over 90% of the time I\\'ve had an awesome time playing this game.Also, the game has never crashed for me.', helpful='132 people found this review helpful, 18 people found this review funny', rewards=0, hrs_on_record=65.7),\n",
       " SteamReview(text=\"I love Bannerlord, but can not recommend it in its current state. When I bought the game on its release, I really enjoyed playing it and was excited to see what the devs would do with the game. I have now revisited the game though, and am fairly disappointed with the progress of its development. I am happy that the developers have fine tuned many of the game mechanics and fixed many of its numerous bugs, but feel that this is really the only thing that they have completed. The devs have still not implemented many vital features, such as perks effects. Currently, most perks don't work; out of the 12 perk trees that exist, 5 of them contain perks whose effects don't work, and another 3 have less than 20% of their perks working. Other missing features include some mechanics regarding sieges, kingdom management, and crafting. There has also been very little in the way of any new armors or weapons, which would not be a problem if modding tools were released. However, mod support has yet to be released, and its modding community has subsequently died. My overall opinion is that the game has been released for 5 ½ months, and in that time, has made little significant progress in the way of attracting its player base back. I would recommend that anybody who is on the fence about purchasing the game wait until mod support drops.Edit: If anybody wants to see what perks are and aren't working, check this: Also, the devs officially announced that the first batch of modding tools is planned for release by the end of August: 2nd Edit: Its September 10th, almost a month later, and they have not released modding tools yet.

       " SteamReview(text=\"Ah yes, Bannerlord.More than a year ago, the first glimpse of releasing the game to EA, to be actually playable, after years and years of teasing, was a great moment for this game. People flocked to the early access chance in huge numbers, I mean, EVERYONE boarded the hype train, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, what a hype train it was. New Youtubers were born just thanks to the EA release.The game received enormous amount of support, praising the new visuals, the new game engine and overall look. It was an instant hit on Steam.Then, the Warband community stepped in and showed the issues the game had, outlined the perks and mechanics that are not working, and the overall lack of content in the game, outside of gathering troops and swinging swords.I thought to myself - They must be wrong, the game is good, it is exactly what I expected, swinging swords, leading troops, winning battles. Tens of hours later (and months and months IRL time later after EA), the realization kicked in - they are right. After the novelty of the new eye catching game engine wears off, this game just has nothing to offer.Modding support is great for any game. It keeps it alive for years to come - just look at Cities Skylines. The modding community has kept the game alive all these years after the initial release, and if one would run the numbers, it still generates hefty income on sales - YEARS after release.Why am I mentioning modding support, you'd ask?Well, it is quite simple - it is acceptable for the game to be extended with great mods after initial release, it's just there is this elephant in the room that started to grow as soon as Bannerlod hit the EA - if you step back and look at this game, nothing has changed within the game itself and it has been on life support from modding community - WHILE STILL BEING IN EARLY ACCESS.- Balance fixes- AI fixesThese two points can describe the year Bannerlord has spent in EA. No mechanics have been added to the game.How is it possible for a game to not change that much after a year in EA, while modding community can churn out fixes for the problems the game has faster than developers can?How come, the community can create and release new mechanics for the game, while the developers have not even mentioned a single thing that is coming?The Early Access title has become a badge of shame for Bannerlord.It is a fun game for the initial hours of gameplay, dont get me wrong, but it has nothing more to offer once the initial novelty wears off, and the non-existant roadmap or anything in that regard does not help much.I don't know what to recommend you guys - if you want couple of hours of fun, sure, buy it, but remember that in that way, you are supporting the ongoing problem with this game, hence I am leaving a thumbs down for this.\", helpful='558 people found this review helpful, 15 people found this review funny', rewards=52, hrs_on_record=135.2),\n",

       " SteamReview(text=\"For anybody looking to buy this game, I'd say to wait until considerable improvements are made on it's development. Having said that, I very much enjoy some aspects of this game and have sunk a fair amount of hours into it when I've been in the mood to play it.Sieges are completely broken, in my opinion. You cannot order your men around efficiently at all without delegating command to the ai. Troops will crowd around the bottom of siege towers and not use ladders. They also wait in large blobs getting picked off until the last minute before getting to the ladders. Then when they actually do go up ladders they do so as slowly as possible, one at a time. Not very fun watching your party of men that you spent hours training up fighting looter parties getting picked off one by one by peasant archers due to their own stupidity. This problem has been persistent since release and a major reason why I choose to auto resolve all sieges. Yet the devs spend too much time re-balancing items and perks and updating sheep models and textures that no one cares about.Battles can be very frustrating, particularly in villages due to the fact you spawn less than 100 metres away from the enemy and don't have any time to get into formation. You should at least have pre-deployment options like in total war for example. Large battles are utterly ridiculous. Say you are winning a 1000 vs 1000 battle and you push back the enemy, they will constantly spawn on you and it just turns into a complete brawl with disregard to formation or tactics. Not very good if you are not in command (i.e. in an army). I don't see why you cant end the battle after the first 'wave' and fight large battles in stages just like in M&B Warband, for example. Aside from the known pathfinding issues, the ai is questionable at times in one on one fights i.e. standing still and staring at each other for a few seconds doing nothing.Ordering troops can be very clumsy. I feel like a 'command mode' that allows you to place your troops using the mouse while you stay back (as any good commander should!) would be beneficial. You should also be able to order your troops to skirmish, protect flanks, volley fire, spear brace etc. as seen in mods in the previous instalment, M&B Warband. When you tell archers to advance they seem to run right up to the enemy at sword striking range without firing and immediately running away somewhere you don't want them to, instead of skirmishing properly. Cavalry are almost impossible to control properly without delegating to the ai and may charge into spearman against your will.For a game that I (and every other fan) have been waiting 8 years to play, I feel somewhat disapointed. Even though I have fun playing the game, after 30 mins of playing the game my immersion is broken in some way, therefore, I wouldn't recommend for new players until the game is out of early access. If this had been released in 2016 or even 2018 when they had released videos of a seemingly functional game, I would have said different, but 8 years for what we have got here is ridiculous.\", helpful='383 people found this review helpful, 11 people found this review funny', rewards=33, hrs_on_record=304.6),\n",
       " SteamReview(text=\"Bannerlord was estimated to be in early access for 1 year. We're now approaching the 2nd year mark of early access. Bannerlord is not bad game or one that I wouldn't recommend. The devs on the other hand have entirely lost sight of the project. The devs think they are some kind of super mega company super stars that can just ignore their fans. The siege AI has been broken for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ages and the devs haven't even bothered to acknowledge the problem exists instead they put out much more meaningful updates such being able to raise your fist in MP now. I'm sure all 2 people that are still active in MP liked that update. Since the start of the game the devs have been adding new towns, cities and castles which do look very good, but what is the point if the game is so shallow there is literally no point in going to these places? Hey look guys, the devs have added 2 new taverns for Dickburg and Pisstadia along with bug fixes in a 9 gb update. How many times will you actually go to these taverns? Never, there is no point in exploring anywhere in this game. NPCs just repeat the exact same 3 lines, your dialogue choices don't matter. It's actually laughable if you order a drink from a waitress through dialogue nothing even happens she just walks away but oooo you can play the exact same boardgame in every tavern. Such an immersive experience indeed. The devs think they can turn this game into an E-sport. Well to that I need to remind them that E-sports needs not only an audience but also players which Bannerlord multiplayer has neither. The drive of Mount and Blade has always been the singleplayer and its sandbox do whatever you want experience not multiplayer which the devs pile more and more resources into while singleplayer sits there a shallow repetitive broken bore. Now back when I mentioned the length of this game being in early access, It wouldn't be a big deal that the game stayed in early access longer than intended, delays happen and with covid keeping that efficiency would no doubt be hard. The problem that I have with the devs keeping the game in early access is because the updates they put out are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ empty, at the rate of progression maybe if you revisit this game in 3 years it may just about be ready to leave early access. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE BANNERS IN THE GAME CALLED ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BANNERLORD YET. TaleWorlds, you don't need to put out a new update every single time you add 1 tiny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing, save those features and cobble them together with massive game changing updates to make it actually exciting. No one is going to get back into the game because I can now upgrade my party members to lords, nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥ about that on its own or any of the other ♥♥♥♥♥ minor feature you add. Devs really need to get their finger out their ass and actually work on their game and allocate their resources back into singleplayer. I love the game, but my patience with the devs since release has been tested time and time again, €50 for this is just a joke.\", helpful='104 people found this review helpful, 4 people found this review funny', rewards=15, hrs_on_record=104.0),\n",
       " SteamReview(text='Bear with me, this is a doozy, and may be the only steam review I ever actually write. I had astronomical hopes for this game... I played Warband religiously for years, accumulating hundreds upon hundreds of hours. It was my go-to and I have many, many fond memories from my childhood playing that game. It\\'s among my all-time favorites. I was there when Bannerlord was announced, I diligently checked for and read new dev diaries. I remember when each faction, each new mechanic was announced. I followed this game\\'s development for the entire long slog. I remember when the EA was announced, to the cheers of \"It\\'s almost harvesting season!\" from the fanbase. I was ready to forgive just about any goof or gaff that Tale Worlds committed all for the chance to play the game that I had waited literally my entire middle school/high school/most of college life. I didn\\'t buy at first (I did not have a good enough computer and I was troubled by some preliminary responses. Finally, I got it. I\\'ve played it for over one hundred hours now. It has so much that I loved from Warband, and I HAVE had some tremendous fun playing at times.However, here I am leaving a negative review. I waited eight long years for this game, with an additional 10 months or so of EA development, and the game is STILL noticeably unfinished. The factions are still atrociously unbalanced (plz fix the Khuzaits, they are still monstrously OP even after your 1.5.7 beta nerf). The companions have taken a large step down even from Warband, basically sacrificing any semblance of personality in exchange for sheer number of available companions. The AI still has no idea how to conduct anything resembling effective diplomacy (forgivable in 2010, but 100% inexcusable in the modern era of EXCELLENT grand strategy games. The technology is absolutely there). Factions declare idiotic wars they could never win and then refuse to make peace even when attacked by multiple factions at once. The tribute system is indecipherable, there are still potentially campaign-ending bugs, snowballing is still a huge issue, and executions are useless because the AI never uses them (in my experience) and the consequences for the player executing a lord are so steep that you basically have to commit your entire playthrough as a borderline genocide run, because your relation with a TON of clans (many of them random-ass clans from across Calradia that should not be batting an eye at this) will be irreparably ruined. The AI certainly has no concept of how to actually fight a battle, forcing you to either always have a massive party to outnumber your enemy (impossible because of party size limits and the relatively steep influence cost it takes to form and maintain a large army) or micromanage the crap out of every soldier you have, in real time, while also trying to actually have fun and fight/not instantly die. They\\'ve gotten rid of almost all passive experience gain, so the only way to upgrade troops is by grinding out boring battles with looters (who, as a further slap in the face, seem to always kill exactly one of your top tier troops in the process because the battle simulation sucks ass. And because top tier \"noble\" troops are so hard to find in the first place, let alone upgrade for the reasons previously listed, I hope you enjoyed having that elite cataphract for all of two days). They haven\\'t even implemented all the perks for the skill tree yet, after all this time. I say all this to say that I\\'m very disappointed, even frustrated, with how this game was developed so far. I don\\'t mean this to be personal because I know that Tale Worlds has, to their massive credit, been working hard at patching out bugs and rebalancing things as best as they can, when they could have just taken the money and run. I\\'m just left scratching my head wondering why this game, the one we have currently, took so long based on what\\'s there.Take this review as more of a caution against the EA game in its current state. Let me be clear, the bones for a tremendous game are there, I promise. Like I said, I did have plenty of fun with this game despite its issues. I\\'ve just reached a point at which I can no longer ignore them, and they are a bit too glaring for me to continue having fun with this game for the time being. I\\'ll be taking a break for a while. For those of you considering buying at this point: wait. Watch for hotfixes, patches, and updates. Read the forums and see how things seem to be progressing. Hold off until this games reaches its full release, at the very least. Devs, you haven\\'t lost me yet, but my trust in you has been strained. Please, please, iron things out, and I will be back to dumping my hours into this game like I\\'m a 12 year old playing Warband again. I will promptly delete or otherwise edit this review when that time comes.For now, I will sit tight.

       " SteamReview(text='Update 2021 July 14:The game has improved a lot over the past year. Most notably (for me, at least):* Much quicker load times, especially between different scenes;* Better FPS and FPS stability;* Significantly reduced bugs;* The addition of a few \"fetch\" or \"go there, kill that\" quests.However, the game still lacks a lot of substance. Once you get into the mid game, your gameplay goes into a cycle of:War -> Go pick-off enemy lords one by one, make money from selling loot and ransoming there; Or assemble an army and go siege a town;Peace -> Ride around looking for war horses and levelling your troops.Rinse and repeat.Siege AI is still INCREDIBLY stupid. I can\\'t emphasize this enough, it\\'s just non-existent, really. If you\\'re trying to join a siege with other lords, they will just send their troops to scale the walls, then RECALL them, and then just leave them to stand in the middle of the field, getting blasted by mangonels. So much potential fun with sieges, but completely wasted on absolutely retarded (non-existent) AI.I\\'m really hoping the gameplay will be expanded further down the line. Original review below.__________To quote the devs: \"We don’t believe in releasing a game before it is ready just because we might miss the hype\". Oh, the irony... Some bullet-points:  *   There is very little to do in the game. Apart from the basic \"acquire troops, train them, fight, go acquire more troops, repeat\", there\\'s not much else left of substance.  *   The skill tree / perks are broken or just plain not implemented;  *   Quests are absolute rubbish. Here\\'s a taster: deliver cattle from this town to the next; follow a caravan around, go to the next village and talk to an NPC. Zero creativity went into making these quests;  *   Companions are dull and uninspiring, there\\'s very little you can do with them. Some things you CAN use them for are: 1) as an extra soldier; 2) as a party leader. The latter one is pretty cool, you can set them up to basically become like the other lord NPCs, meaning the companion will wander around the map, gather and train troops, engage bandits and enemy factions. Unfortunately, they will be captured, sooner rather than later. Then you, a lord of 2 cities and 3 castles, will have to journey across the land just to fetch the failed party leader from a bl**dy tavern; You can also set them up to lead caravans, which have the potential to make you extra money, but that\\'s it. They get captured too easily that way, and you lose the initial investment you paid to set up the caravan.  *   Sieges play out like a game with the bots set on the lowest difficulty. The AI clearly struggles with path-finding, and has very rudimentary \"assault\" AI. Basically, they will get stuck on ladders, at the bottoms of ladders, in front of the gate, on top of the ladder. Although I do expect this will be sorted out;  *   There\\'s close to zero interaction options with other NPCs - you can play some minigames with them (board games), ask them about a previous war (they\\'ll give a short story about it, nothing too interesting), ask them about the current situation (they will give a very generic reply) or try to barter with them. With a few exceptions, that\\'s pretty much it;  *   There\\'s close to zero diplomacy, apart from wars/peace. If you do make peace with a faction, that faction will likely declare war on you a few days later;There is a \"feudal council\" system, where lords in a faction can vote to pass certain laws, which is a cool feature and does seem to work relatively well.  *   So many broken mechanics I can\\'t be bothered to list them all... But perhaps my worst experience (in terms of gameplay) was in relation to enemy AI lords fixated on raiding my villages. The situation was one where at the start of the war, an enemy lord started looting one of my villages. I quickly defeated and imprisoned this lord, only to see 2 more enemy parties coming to raid the same village. I made little work of them, as well, capturing the lords. Not a day has passed, and I defeated a couple of more lords, at which point the first lord has escaped. A couple of days go by, I now have maybe 8 lords as prisoners in my party and what do I see..? The first lord whom I defeated is back with a new army. The other captured lords also eventually escape (regardless of whether I hold them in my party or put them in a dungeon), and I end up in an endless cycle of defeating, capturing lords, them escaping and returning with new armies. Ridiculously frustrating.Overall, I just cannot express enough, the utter disappointment I have with the game. I do not see where the developer time went, allegedly the game was in development for MANY years. I remember seeing playable demos back in, what, 2017? The game was announced way back in 2012. Now we\\'re in 2020, and they decided to go for the money grab (I refer your to the quote from the devs at the top of the review) and release the game as \"\"Early Access\"\". To be fair, at first it seemed quite alright. In the first half of April 2020, we were getting pretty substantial updates every day, ironing out bugs and adding small bits to the game. But then they decided to switch to a \"larger weekly\" update schedule. As of writing this review (May 31st), we\\'ve had exactly 4 larger \"weekly\" updates, with the latest being dated May 15th. This week the update included fixes for 4 or 5 instances of game crashes, basically a micro-patch. At these rates, I am no longer hopeful to see a \"\"Full release\"\"\" of the game. In summary: The game in its current state just feels empty, lifeless. Contrary to what others have noted, there is actually very little to do. The grind feels alright at the beginning, when you\\'re building your skills and acquiring equipment and troops, but it gets old really fast. You can, as I did, start the game from zero at that point, but really, after your 5th restart you can\\'t be bothered anymore.The game is on sale at full retail price, and is available to anyone. At this point hiding behind the \"\"Early Access\"\" designation is just cynical, in my opinion.My recommendation: do not buy the game, it\\'s not worth it in its current state. Wait for the game to be \"\"Officially\"\" released, and read the reviews then.', helpful='1,402 people found this review helpful, 56 people found this review funny', rewards=84, hrs_on_record=191.3),\n",
       " SteamReview(text='Should you try Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord? It\\'s a big maybe. \"Hang on a second, dude. You have 160 hours on the clock!\" you might say but that was actually just to try something and it\\'s the whole reason why it is a maybe. 160 hours of gameplay for a 50€ title is definitely okay but this title is falling short in a LOT of areas and I don\\'t think the finished game will be able to change that.Let me explain:I tried to capture the entire world map which I honestly can only recommend if you want to see what this game is NOT good at:- getting clans onboard: this is luckbased and you can ONLY persuade existing clans to switch sides, with a good chunk of luck and A LOT of gold involved. 2-5 million to switch to you is no rare sight. Even when you are ruling the vastly bigger kingdom, no one will ever voluntarily switch over. If you crushed one kingdom, the clans will simply move over to different kingdoms - but never ever your own. - managing your clans: simply not possible. They do what they want are are mostly incompetent. Breaking off sieges in the middle, not trying to protect villages and forming armies on one side of the map, trying to get all the way over to the other side which does not work because the army will run out of cohesion. - marriage and inheritance: gives you virtually nothing as far as I could tell. There is simply no system whatsoever that would give you any rights to titles or anything. In fact, something as rights and titles isn\\'t even in the game. It\\'s just an attribute the game selects for the ruling dude and if he dies it randomly hops over to someone else, in many cases even from a different clan. - battles: great fun and all in the first few rounds with smaller armies of like 50 vs. 50. Once you go into the 300\\'s (both sides combined) you will find many battlefields are simply too small. The enemy AI is also mostly trying to avoid fighting by going hard left or right from their spawn position where you have to lure them out. Since there can only be 400 soldiers on the battlefield at any given point enemies will simply spawn in as you are defeating them, especially in battles against larger armies. So you and your men made it to the enemies (that just waited near their spawn point), you overwhelm them just to get more enemies spawned right in the middle of your troops, causing huge casualties. This is just a really bad system, especially if have to fight \"wave after wave\" of these spawns. Tiresome and NOT fun. - battle simulations: basically random results. Even if you have 150 men vs. 26 looters chances are they kill one of yours, especially very high level units like Battarian Heroes or Elite Cataphracts. This just does not make sense. If you play the battle personally they are not even getting near your units before bailing and yet in a simulation they kill one of the best units. The simulation also does not scale. If you have very large armies (600+) against similar sized armies, you suddenly get away with just 8 casualties. If you try a 200 vs. 200 the results look quite different. Its just very unpredictable and intransparent. I always avoided simulations for the majority of fights to avoid loosing good units. - sieges: it really is funny that the video on this shop page from 2016 shows a lot more features than are actually functioning in the game. Sieges are boring and messy. If you use ladders, siege towers or you breached the enemy walls does not matter much in most cases. You will still have to run up against a shield wall that you can easily run around and slaughter the enemy from behind. There are no really strategic options that would make it interesting or challenging. The only challenge you can have is going up against 400 men with just 50. Also, the enemies spawn directly in the courtyard in front of the gate, which is great if that is where your men are currently fighting. The spawning is just daft. - wars: essentially the other kingdoms will constantly spam you with war declarations. As there is no grants, titles or rights implemented in this game, there is no visible reason as to why this happens. At some point you are at war with basically everyone further exposing the completely incompetent own clan AI. Since villages create an endless supply of soldiers, those wars never end and you end up fighting an army against the very same guys you just had let go after a fight over and over and over again. Such fun!- own parties: As the leader of your clan you can create parties that you can also call to your army at any time for free.Sadly those parties are constantly being wiped out and do NOT recreate themselves. It has to be done manually while the enemy AI immediately sends out beaten heroes again to recruit from the endless peasant supply and go to battle again. - trading: Yes, possible but you cannot achieve anything with it, aside from getting rich. You cannot buy titles or castles or land or anything, since such system are simply not implemented and not even hinted at.You can create Caravans but much like your own parties, they constantly get wiped out and not replaced. It\\'s just another hassle to deal with for very little benefit. - crime: every city has a crime lord or two but in the end they are completely meaningless. Being on the bad side of the law is meaningless too. Even when you are on the good side you are constantly in wars with everyone so the reason why you fight comes down to your own roleplaying if you are into that sort of thing. Being an outlaw has no benefits, special mechanics or anything. Just everyone hates you but that will happen eventually anyway.economy: since the wars are neverending in this game, the economy suffers greatly. The AI will just go from city to city and buy all the food that is there, completely stripping it empty. Stationed garrisons will then desert since there is no food for them left. Its just a completely unmoderated system, much like the endless peasants. So, all in all I hope this gave you an insight. The TL;DR of this is: this game would need at least 5 years of early access to put all the required systems in place to make this a diverse playing experience. The novelty of playing those battles wears of quite quickly and there really is not much else in this game. Any kind of systems to manage your clan or kingdom, the economy, diplomacy.. it\\'s all not existing. The mod-community is trying to help out and they have created fantastic mods but it shouldn\\'t be their job to fill those huge gaps. This game has been out for an entire year now but is missing SO much. I don\\'t have any hopes of the things I described ever to become a reality since their predecessors were not particulary good at those either AND none of what is missing is even really hinted at.

       " SteamReview(text='This game is the perfect follow-up for anyone who loved Warband or the original Mount & Blade. It\\'s still in early access, but I think if you, like me, have borderline exhausted Warband, this is the next step. Although, it is a lot more complicated than its predecessors, and the game does introduce you to its new systems fairly well, there are some things you should be made aware of before you start.1) The entire game revolves around a clan mechanic. No longer are you a starting adventurer with nothing and no one, now you have a clan. You rise and fall with your clan. When you die (yes, you can die), you take over as someone else from your clan. There is now an actual reason for getting married, but the clan system can take away some of the fun of Warband where it was just you. Starting the game, you have several siblings whose lives you are in charge of, and because of this, it can feel micromanagy at times. Clan tiers are a thing, and the game locks you out of some of the more fun aspects of Warband (like starting your own kingdom), until you hit a certain clan tier. So just bear with it.2) The whole trade system is weird. In Warband, to become a merchant, you just had to buy and sell goods and open an enterprise. Here, you can make caravans for yourself and buy multiple workshops. Right now, they\\'re pretty nerfed, so check out the mod community.3) Kingdom management is a lot more complicated. Whether you are a vassal or a monarch, there\\'s a lot going on, so don\\'t feel bad for looking things up or pausing the game just to read through the kingdom screen (press K). This isn\\'t Crusader Kings, but it can still be overwhelming.4) Mods work with native. Unlike in Warband, for the most part, mods here affect your native gameplay, and some work with new updates and some don\\'t. I recommend playing the game for about thirty hours without mods, then adding a few in. But like any Elder Scrolls veteran can tell you, try adding one at a time in case it starts crashing your game.5) Years pass quickly. I\\'ve had Warband playthroughs where I conquer Calradia in about a year and a half. Here, it\\'s much different. Years pass quick, and you\\'ll still probably be doing the first two missions by the end of year two on your first playthrough.6) There is a story (kind of). Like Skyrim, the game locks you out of the fun stuff until you do the early story quests, and one of them can be a nightmare. Feel free to look up guides, because at this point, most of the mods to help you with it do not work with the current update (written October 26, 2021). There is a point to the story, it explains why the world is the way it is, but I don\\'t blame you for just doing sandbox after your third or fourth start.7) The game is early access. Things change all the time. Things are buffed and nerfed like no other. Don\\'t be discouraged. The modding community is great, and there are a ton of things to help. Right now, workshops are dead in the water, but there are mods to make them not be a bane when they should be a boon. Please don\\'t feel weird or bad for using cheats after you have to restart because an update killed your perfect playthrough, or you\\'re using an OP mod because you\\'re last character was almost king of all Calradia, but now because you\\'re a Sturgian, you\\'re getting culture penalties everywhere. Just don\\'t sweat it.Overall, this is one of the most fun games I\\'ve ever played, and it is a true sequel to the original games. If you think you can live with the early access \"features\" pick it up. If not, just wait. And if you\\'ve never played a Mount & Blade game before, I would recommend either starting here or Warband. Warband might be a more consistent experience, but if it doesn\\'t hook you, pick this game up on the cheap.', helpful='55 people found this review helpful, 3 people found this review funny', rewards=1, hrs_on_record=152.5),\n",

The development team clearly lacks direction in nearly every conceivable aspect and/or severely deviates from what originally felt like a more coherent vision. The current team\\'s biggest Achilles\\' heel is its own incompetence; when they attempt to add new features or fine tune a previously existing feature--usually something that clearly had more complex coding but maybe needed tweaking--it tends to backfire severely and cheapens the entire experience. And that applies to everything, from gameplay to artistic direction (which, as a visual artist, especially irritates me). There are far more competent programers and designers in the modding community, but Taleworlds appears to constantly be shafting their betters. Obviously the potential in the game is there, but potential alone will not carry a game like this...Some quick takes:There are lots of pretty dope things I like about BL which are mostly minor, easily overlooked things outside of the core gameplay, including...The details where they exist in this game are impressive, there was clearly a lot of effort invested into building this world which is greatly appreciated and helps immerse you in the game. Unfortunately, that\\'s where the praise stops as BL is the kind of game where its left hand has no f$%ing idea what its right hand is doing and it will become apparent to you the longer you hang on. There just feels like a huge lack of quality control and project management here and Taleworlds has apparently never heard of the saying \"if it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it\".That said, here\\'s an incomplete list of things that have become super off-putting to me at this point, with the glaringly obvious things like perks, AI problems, blah blah blah and whatnot being left out:I genuinely hate some of these changes so much I\\'ve gone back game versions JUST to grab some of the files from back then to implant them in the latest version of the game, including textures and I\\'m legit blown away by how much better certain things were back then.

Accosted by a larger group, not mere looters but the dreaded bandits of the forest. Eagle-Eyed archers skilled in their craft. Out numbered we were picked off from afar. My loyal retinue dropping on the flanks as their shields could protect them no longer, arrows burst what little armour protected them and claimed their lives before we could even see the foe. My own horse was claimed, I fell.Next came the charge, we met our foe with even less men now. We fought hard and bloodied our blades but it wasn't enough. Soon enough I looked around me to realise that my men were dead and dying, one was even fleeing the battlefield. It was too late for me, surrounded and bloodied I was beaten.

       " SteamReview(text='Huge potential, but atm the game is barely working gameplay-wise. They haven\\'t delivered on any of their big promises yet be it dynasty system, diplomacy or whatever, and have only been pumping technical fixes for half a year now and doing dumb things like nerfing income such as workshops and whatnot while smithing hasn\\'t been touched AT ALL in all this time and allows you to easily make, say, two-handers that sell for 150k each (while cities have 3-4 times less gold in their inventory) after just a few stamina bars spent on unlocking parts. Hell, you don\\'t even need all that fancy steel and such, can make javelins out of wood and iron and still bankrupt cities with a bundle of those. It\\'s like an inbuilt money cheatcode. Still, 95% of every patch is crashfixes and refactoring. I only paid them so they could refactor their monkey code that should\\'ve been in order in the first place, or so it seems.In general balance is all over the place. Such as prices. Some mediocre bodyarmor costs like half a hundred of decent horses or a thousand pieces of grain, truly endgame armor costs several times more, but you can ride the whole world and not find a single one, those barely spawn with default values even after creating more smithies. Khuzaits have too big of an autoresolve and movement speed bonus and dominate the map. Troop trees are questionable to say the least, half the factions have way worse troops than other ones, there isn\\'t even any \"they are meh but they are real good at that one area\" thing going on anymore, like battanians are meant to be master archers but their only archers are noble troops and good luck getting those in any number, or sturgians who are supposed to be the shocktroop kind of guys but aserai and arguably even empire have better heavy infantry, half the factions have horse archers now though if that\\'s your thing. Individual troop equipment and stats still need heavy adjustment, and although there already were a couple of those, they somehow only seem to make matters worse. Some mechanics from warband aren\\'t here yet either, kingdom management is extremely barebones, underwhelming and just feels lazily tackled-on, recruiting is somehow even more obnoxious than previous instalments, and lack of effective training skill means that losing a good army takes a looong while to recover from for the player, whereas AI lords, just as before, summon huge leveled armies out of thin air. AI lords are incredibly stupid too, most of all at sieges, so even the vassal phase is going to be painful. Especially after they nerfed all the influence gain so as a vassal you will only be able to lead an army once in a blue moon, rest of the time being relegated to watching them trying to build a trebuchet for weeks which gets obliterated in seconds, then disbanding the siege, then doing it all over again. The siege system is laughable in general but it\\'s a fairly minor complaint in the face of big problems in the game.TL;DR: for another year or so, just play modded warband. As of now, the game seems great when you are starting out, but once you get to the endgame and start to uncover it\\'s inner workings, it all just falls apart and burns. Gameplay loop is way less thought-out than warband\\'s and in a game such as this it\\'s all that matters in the end. I hope they will deliver on all they promised meanwhile.

       " SteamReview(text='The TL;DR is that this game is not worth full price at 50 $ or whatever your currency is. There simply isn\\'t enough in the game to justify buying it.+Siege battles: These, for the most part are fun, it was great to finally be able to play this with 1,000 troops. It is really cool to load into the siege as an attacker and charge the walls while looking up into the sky and seeing a fireball from a catapult on a collision course for the city wall. Things do kind of drag on a bit after you\\'ve taken the walls and you have to chop away at a literal block of troops forming a shield wall behind the gate, but overall it\\'s still fun. It\\'s also really terrifying to see troops pile up to get on one siege tower. It\\'s like watching a swarm of pissed off bees or a recreation of World WarZ.+Graphics: The environmental graphics on max settings are absolutely stunning. Every time I enter a battle I always take in how beautiful everything looks without a care while forest bandits massacre my troops.+Map/level design: The world map makes clear that it was meticulously made to be beautiful, detailed, and informative. The amount of detail isn\\'t really needed, but definitely appreciated. Level design from Battle maps to walking around a city is always exciting to look at, and is even further enhanced by the graphics.+Combat and death animations: From what I\\'ve seen there\\'s a fair number of people that are still on the fence about the combat, so I know this is highly subjective, but I actually like it! When I swing my sword it\\'s like my character is actually putting effort into it, it\\'s even better when I\\'m hitting someone (or a goose) with it. Death animations are a nice detail and welcome contrast compared to Warband\\'s spinning death animation. Hitting someone in the neck with an arrow or knocking someone off their horse and pinning them to the ground with a javelin is oddly satisfying (I swear I\\'m not a psycopath)!+Soundtrack: Music in Bannerlord is amazing. The music makes straight flexing on 11 looters with 30 heavy cavalry seem epic!+More choice and skill trees: In Warband you either go to tournaments or raid villages to make a majority of your money, in this you can become a trader, a criminal, or remain the classic mercenary to earn your money (even though all of those methods are pretty slow, since this game is pretty grindy. Sad face). The skill tree makes going with a more supportive and commanding role more interesting and viable rather than becoming a one man army and make your companions do the support role.-Story and quests: At the beginning when making your character and during the tutorial the storyline seems modest, but interesting. Your original goal is to save your younger siblings from slavery by buying their freedom. After asking 10 (pretty hard to find) lords about a battle in the past in order to find out about what the relic in your possession is and what it is worth, and after learning what is and getting the remaining fragments of the relic you somehow (and I swear I am not making this up) make the leap to giving it to someone for... free... Or become a revolutionary and rule the land yourself... I guess the main character is playing the long game to save little Jimmy and Jenny (the younger siblings). As for the regular/everyday quests it\\'s mostly people asking you to deliver livestock to a city or someone asking you to protect a family member because they got a little kill hungry. Small variety of quests and all quite bland.-NPCs: Almost all of the NPCs in the game seem soulless; just things on the map so it doesn\\'t feel as empty. In Warband, with the exception of companions, NPC lords weren\\'t really unique, but with some of the dialogue they used and and some of their reactions to your actions made it seem like you were actually building a rapport through your hard work and helped build your story. For companions in Warband if there were 2 companions who didn\\'t like each other and no companions they did like they would argue and bring it to you to pick a side, and expect you to resolve it or else, one or at worst case scenario they both would leave. In this game companions don\\'t fight, they have copy & pasted bios of themselves to other companions in the game, they basically do nothing, and they have no personality.-NPC design and facial expressions: Okay, if you looked at the portrait of a lord/lady or companion through the encyclopedia you\\'ll probably think: \"these guys look pretty normal\". But once you actually speak with one of them you are dragged right back to the horrific nightmare that was Mass Effect Andromeda with the camera work of Middle-earth Shadow of War. They all look really dumb and ugly, especially when they make this triangle shape with their mouth or this weird smirk (which is almost all the time). They all look like vain, neanderthals that are uglier than the characters in Warband. It gets worse if you decide to let them go after defeating them in battle and they show (what I\\'m assuming is) a face of gratitude, but really it\\'s the face an insane person makes when they charge at you with a knife. Meanwhile, the game is telling me that little gargoyle who looks like Yoda and Post Malone had a one night fling is my child!-AI: I can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this, but the AI in this game is actually dumber than the AI in Warband (a game made in 2010 BTW). In Warband if an NPC detects someone aiming their bow at them they will raise their shield until they get within melee range. In this game they won\\'t raise their shield unless you tell them to form a shield wall or if they get hit with an arrow, and if they do get with an arrow they will raise their shield until the next arrow hits and then forget the archer shooting at them exists and lower their shield again, or... unless they get within 4 meters of the archers. Also, I understand when the player goes through a learning curve for the combat and timing of the game, but not the AI. Cavalry in this game will miss people standing still a LOT. I get balancing Cavalry so they aren\\'t OP, but get these guys some glasses! The only real improvement to the AI are the cav. archers as they circle around and harass infantry, and the occasional time when a lord uses/utilizes formations and strategy.-Hollow features and general lack of content: This game feels lacking in content shortly after finishing the tutorial the game can quickly become stale aside from trying different units from the different factions. A lot of the current features in this game feel like they were freshly implemented just after their conceptual phase. A few examples (which is all I can make because I am running out of space, believe me there\\'s a lot) of the many minor problems that add up to be big problems that plague this game are: AI lords being able to recover quickly after battle and raiding the same village literally a day and a half later (they are essentially spam bots). The grind in this game is really bad, it takes a long time to get money and exp. This game has been out for 5 months now and there are STILL skills in the skill tree that don\\'t work!EA shouldn\\'t be an invincibility star and it shouldn\\'t be praised for its \"potential,\" AND for the individual mods mod creators make for it (don\\'t get me wrong, mod tools are a praise worthy feature, but a game shouldn\\'t be dependent on them. Which, sadly seems to be the direction this game is heading). For what this game has to offer currently isn\\'t worth it at full price. And if you are new to Mount & Blade and if you can look past the old graphics I seriously recommend you play Warband that way you\\'ll get your moneys worth even without using mods (I would know I spent 300 hrs playing it on console back when i was a pleb and we didn\\'t even get mods), and you\\'ll still be supporting the devs through that game. I sincerely hope this review/critique helps with your decision. :)', helpful='2,276 people found this review helpful, 211 people found this review funny', rewards=8, hrs_on_record=71.2),\n",
       " SteamReview(text='Singleplayer in this game is a step up from Warband for me.Battles feel like they pack a punch. Sieges have been vastly improved, giving the defenders a clear buff still... but not as meat grindy as Warband\\'s sieges... Speaking of sieges, upgrading your towns is more meaningful and visually represented.Your party members are now members of your clan and you can have them do quests for you or form their own parties.More battle commands and formations, to make the combat feel better.Helping AI armies can get you control of a bunch of their units (grouped up by category) and the AI commander will perform a grand battle plan where it gives orders to you and the other (AI) commanders.If you want to buy Bannerlord for multiplayer only... I highly suggest you hold of for now.Personally I find \"captain\" and \"siege\" to be interesting experiences, but the \"Skirmish\" mode is quite garbage. On top of that there is a class system for multiplayer with very limited choices for equipment. Gone are the days of making your own builds, or taking funny equipment for a siege battle or deathmatch. Since the Alpha test the developers have made it clear that they absolutely won\\'t move an inch away from the class system, so no luck expecting that to get better.Taleworld\\'s priority is currently heavily towards SP and thus MP is not really getting much attention beyond fixing crashes or critical bugs. (Fixing glitches on maps is a rare thing to see)Owing to all of that I can easily recommend the game for SP but not for MP.', helpful='83 people found this review helpful, 3 people found this review funny', rewards=16, hrs_on_record=299.4),\n",
       " SteamReview(text='With all the recent updates, I\\'d have to give this game an 8/10. I really do like it, and want to see it the game finished and out of beta phase. There\\'s a ton of things I\\'d still like to see implemented in the game, but I will wait patiently. Even if nothing more is added, my rating for this game won\\'t change. I enjoy the game as is, and mods only make it more fun. The current game is set to feel more like a Warhammer game, with you as the physical commander unit. Unfortunately for you, unless you\\'re up against a bunch of peasants with pitchforks or bandits with pointy rocks and butter knives, you\\'re going to struggle in larger combat scenarios if you try to go head to head against the enemy. The AI isn\\'t very smart, and they\\'ll pull some really stupid moves when given control. I can\\'t count how many times I\\'d given the AI free reign of my troops while I charge the front lines with my personally crafted 2-handed sword, and I find myself in the same situation as Optimus Prime--fighting in the woods alone surrounded by 6-150 enemies with real army equipment. Unless I\\'m late enough in the game to have my Fitness skill high enough to outrun most troops, that\\'s a good way for me to find myself dead. The easiest way to go against armies is actually pretty realistic. Skirmish with an archer unit while cavalry flanks with their lances, and have your infantry advance from the side to surround the enemy. When the enemy has heavy cavalry themselves, just use your own horse and aim for their riders with your 2-handed Axe, or a polearm. If you\\'re practiced enough with the bow, you can get headshots on other horsemen for days even at range. In close combat with the real men, It\\'s heavily recommended to use a 2 handed Axe, or the Sword & Shield. I like to make the game more of a challenge and turn off the auto-directional block feature, so having a shield is very helpful to my survival. Especially because more often than not I end up veering away from my infantry line and picking off a group of enemies that leave me backpeddling while swinging my sword trying to survive.Outside of combat, the other game mechanics are pretty interesting. There are several quests offered at random from settlements. Be they villages, towns, and noble lords. The longer you last in a campaign, the more \"challenging\" the quests become. On average the hardest quests are either raiding settlements of a warring faction, or capturing a town that might have upwards to 700 defenders. That leads me into raids and siege battles....Raids are pretty simple, and somewhat difficult to fail. I\\'ve never seen a village with more than 60 defenders, and it\\'s set in an urban area with houses and fences, so it\\'s normally no trouble to deal with the peasant levies. I fear no amount of infantry troops--it\\'s when they have archers and stupid amounts of cavalry I start to be worried. Unless you prepare to fight them in the battle by changing up your formations, you can estimate each enemy horseman is worth 2 of your infantry troops. Sometimes more if your line of archers is left undefended from their charges. In a Siege battle on a castle or a town, sometimes the best answer to the siege being successful is to not build any siege engines at all. There have been numerous instances where I have had better success/less casualties by just using ladders to scale the walls than a wheeled tower. If you have more men than the enemy defending a settlement and you\\'re able to breach the walls, the rest is a cinch and you can essentially auto-resolve. Unless you\\'re using a monster of a computer and set the maximum unit capacity to it\\'s highest setting, there will be several pocket groups of soldiers spawning once a set amount of their unit type die (infantry, archers, horsemen, horse archer) and have set spawn points not too far away from the AI sets them to defend. Once a castle or a town is broken into and your troops start flooding in, you can wholly expect a plethora of the initial craven defenders to break ranks and flee for their pathetic lives. It\\'s a favored pass time of mine to hunt them down before they can escape into the Lord\\'s Hall, since each killed man is nothing more than experience points in my eyes. When attempting to build relations with Lords of the realm, the best way possible is to spend time first as an independent mercenary instead of immediately selling yourself out to the nearest faction. Take your time and do quests for the leading noble houses to build relations, and work on your Roguery skill by raiding caravans from far away kingdoms, and performing Jailbreaks for any and all Lords when you see them locked in a dungeon. They\\'ll be eternally greatful if your efforts are successful. If they\\'re not, you\\'ll find yourself in the same dungeon behind bars alongside them. In the worst case scenario, you\\'ll perform the Jail break, but either you, or the other escapee won\\'t live to see the light of day again. Yes, your player character can, and will eventually die. Either from combat (a warriors death) or from disease or old age.  This can also be toggled on/off in the campaign menu, but it\\'s far more fun that way, and losing can be a very painful experience, especially if you happen to have a spouse or kids. Thankfully, if you have an heir of age, death is not the end. Your new player character will instead be your child, who inherits all the assets of your clan, and potentially your kingdom if you had been named as the ruler. It\\'s most amusing to see the NPC reactions to your new player character, especially if you happen to run into the noble Lord that remembers executing your past character in combat (LOL). Once again, I give this game an 8/10 rating, because it\\'s so much fun, and it\\'s always replayable. Combat never exactly gets boring because of the changing terrains and battle conditions, and the variety of ways you can approach most interactions. I recommend to all gamers that enjoy games like Total War: Warhammer, Conquerors Blade, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Empire at War.', helpful='34 people found this review helpful', rewards=4, hrs_on_record=295.8),\n",

       " SteamReview(text='I grew up on Warband, which is a masterpiece of a sandbox game. I liked Bannerlord (it\\'s visually beautiful, especially the armor and landscape), but the pacing of the early access is much slower than Warbard (catch me training my army for a good 20-30 hours of gameplay before I could even think of creating my own kingdom). Don\\'t get me wrong - combat is EXCELLENT and the visual of the huge armies is spectacular. But it gets repitive. The pace of the game moved faster in Warband: I advanced in a kingdom faster, trained my favorite army, talked some guy into marrying me, and delcared myself (as I am) the rightful ruler of Calradia and then started conquering the map. The flow of the game FELT right. The flow of Bannerlord doesn\\'t quite feel right. The mechanics have the potential to be excellent: the whole mini-board game thing is fun, and I like the more customed interactions, but they don\\'t feel like they go anywhere substantial: it seems harder to gain favor and then another long time to be in a stragetic position to use that favor (speaking of: give me a \"Track Lord\" feature on the map or give me death). The potential of the clan/family feature and the re-vamped governing system are very promising, as are the new economic opportunities, and these might shine as new additions, but even they can feel cumbersome when added to by the game\\'s slow pace. The quests are rough: they aren\\'t actually enjoyable, but in Warband at least they were relatively simple and a break from battle. Bannerlord\\'s are more drawn out with no new experiences/added bonuses than regular gameplay (you either fight or talk to people. It\\'s the same as the entire game, you just have to ride across the entire map first). These games aren\\'t Skyrim, and it shouldn\\'t be, but would be nice to need to use some degree of skill to complete a quest or solve a puzzle rather than just legwork. I\\'m still incredibly excited to see this game\\'s finished product, and it was immersive and fun for a good while, but I might return to Warband which still feels like my medieval home and wait another few months for new updates.', helpful='44 people found this review helpful, 2 people found this review funny', rewards=8, hrs_on_record=65.2),\n",

You gotta be kidding me.Game feels like a remaster of Warband with new graphics and a few new things.I don\\'t care that the game is in early access, when basically all gameplay and concepts from Warband has been brought into this remaster.When the game itself feels so old, i wish they could have polished or done something about the atmosphere they talked about in 2016. Here are some small things i wonder why they haven\\'t done anything about in 8 years of development.1. Can\\'t talk to your own prisoners in your own castle. \"I\\'m not allowed to speak\" (Dude im the freakin ruler)2. Women are refered to as men in quest lines.

First of all, i\\'m not some pro reviewer, i just play games and express what i see and feel about the game IN ITS CURRENT STATE. Question/Statement: \"Why do you continue to play if you don\\'t recommend the game\"Answer: Many reasons. To cut it short, i bought an expensive meal i thought was worth it. Am i going to eat it, even though i don\\'t recommend it? Well yes... It\\'s not like the game is ♥♥♥♥, and i never stated so.Question/Statement: \"Bad criticism, only complains about minor things.... \"Answer: I didn\\'t experience any major bugs or glitches myself. I did crash twice, but that\\'s not something i personally care too much about, because that\\'s something that\\'s very likely to be fixed. Something like NPC interaction and logic IS NOT. NPC\\'s treat you basically the same whether you\\'re a peasant or ruler. I personally care about how the world interacts with you and that\\'s its dynamic and changing in relation to how you progress through the game. And as i said the game lacks heavily on that. Numerous answers from NPC\\'s are just copy pastas. A bonus to this is, when soldiers are waiting to climb the ladder, they just graze at the grass around them or stair up in the sky, which again ruins immersion FOR ME.Small bits of crap adds up to one big pile of crap. (I\\'m not saying bannerlord is crap, cus it\\'s not.)Question/statement: \"Game is not finished, it\\'s EA.....\"Answer: I know and i didn\\'t address small time bugs and glitches. I addressed SOME core issues i see with the game. Issues that I personally care about. Hell, i care less about bugs and glitches than core gameplay and NPC logic and interaction. If the devs do change how NPC\\'s interact and so on, i\\'ll obviously change the review, but i personally doubt a recode of NPC\\'s.TLDR: 2012 gameplay with 2016 graphics.Instead of personal attacks try and form an argument so we can discuss the franchise we all (hopefully) love :D', helpful='1,631 people found this review helpful, 83 people found this review funny', rewards=1, hrs_on_record=45.6),\n",

       " SteamReview(text='Since it\\'s Early Access, I won\\'t talk about bugs or missing features.Does Bannerlord have the potential to be a great game? Absolutely, but it isn\\'t there yet. Not anywhere close.The biggest surprise is the unit promotions, which, unlike other games of this kind, make a meaningful difference on the battlefield. As a direct result, choosing any unit\\'s progression path becomes an integral part of the fun to figure out one\\'s best desired army composition. As a side effect, in the arena tournaments even standard units can become tough nuts to crack. Kudos for that.The two by far most annoying features on the other hand are AI intelligence and kingdom status. The troops are dimmer than a bucket of bricks. The most hilarious blunder so far was my siege defenders deciding to climb DOWN the attackers\\' ladders in order to get butchered piecemeal. And since that is not anywhere braindead enough, they tried so hard to get on the ladder next, that they elbowed each other from the top of the wall into the mote. Way to go, knuckleheads.As for the kingdom status, my beef is not on principle but with actual gameplay. So you somehow have to get a settlement. That doesn\\'t make you a king, however. Now you have to ask permission in the main quest. No joke. As kind of a backdoor, you can become a vassal instead. Sounds nice, when you are limited to a 100 people and the possible enemies each have upward of 12000, but you get the fief your liegelord decides, whether you want it or not. So when your liegelord starts yet another braindead suicide run, you end up with a fief smack in the middle of enemy central. What\\'s worse? The enemy liege may be on his own suicide run, so it takes them forever to overrun your defenses with an invariable ten-to-one ratio. Every day you own that hopeless, burnt-out husk of a fief it empties your coffers with expenses beyond those of your entire army. In effect, that kills the vasall option, and you\\'re back to bootlicking your path through the convoluted main quest. They should fire the designer and every playtester.Another major design blunder is the character leveling. Instead of happily gaining level experience playing whack-the-head with variable victims, you gain experience in order to raise skills. Only the resulting skill points now level the character. Which sounds nice in theory, but has two major stumbling blocks in practice. First, you have a learning limit, which means, once a skill hits the current limit, experience means squat. Second, and maybe worse, since the means to raise the learning limit you get by leveling is less than what you need for the next level, you are forced to develop every skill or else watch your toon treading water. That forces you to follow a skill development script, rather than just developing the character you like. Again, who designs something like that?!?In case this is not obvious, this also nixes the concept of the clan roles (surgeon, scout, etc.) for your companions. Who cares, if you have a 100 medicine surgeon, when he or she is hogging the medicine skill points you desperately need to level? And here goes yet another nice idea down the drain.You may observe, I already played some eighty hours. So why whine about a game, that is evidently worth two full work weeks? Well, for one, Bannerlord is a time sink. You don\\'t get anything done quickly. Said eighty hours were my first campaign, until my happy-go-lucky vasall found his untimely demise defending a fief, he never wanted. Unfortunately, much of these eighty hours passed watching my little band of scalawags follow looters over the landscape at the break-neck speed of an air bubble drifting in a tank of molasses. Why I didn\\'t give them horses? Because by the time, I could afford them, I needed 110. Buying them four at a time, I didn\\'t live long enough to ever see it happen. And just so this is clear, the problem is not slow movement in an of itself. The problem is, that your decision process whether to attack a moving target invariably changes from \"Can I do it?\" to \"Do I spend an in-game day hunting something possibly in the opposite direction?\"What\\'s worse, it kills the trading. Youtube has tons of clips that tell you where to get some fish and where to sell it. They brag with riches like medieval carpet baggers. They just conveniently forget to tell you, that it takes a realtime hour to get from A to B. And that is only if you ignore any moving target, that isn\\'t running in generally the right direction.Which brings me to smithing. Sure, I love crafting. Sure, I know it takes time and is repetitive. Sure, I know that game designers think it\\'s funny to eventually earn a five perecent chance for a legendary weapon. But using every down minute of resting to heal in order to sneak in a smithing skill point, I managed to hoard less than thirty points in eighty hours. 30 out of 300, this is. Which changes the question at hand from \"How cool would it be to smith legendary?\" to \"It takes me how many realtime weeks of exclusively pushing the same three buttons to get there?!?\"In summation, Bannerlord is like a fantastic pizza, which just hasn\\'t been long enough in the oven.

       " SteamReview(text=\"Edit: It's been a few weeks since release and the dev team has been able to squish a lot of the bugs, and mods able to address basically all the issues I had with the game. Combat issues have been (and are being) addressed, XP issues being worked on (and fixed with mods) and various systems receiving a lot of love.As it stands, this is the better sequel to vanilla warband. However, on the surface vanilla warband truly didn't have much to offer for merc / vassal / kingdom relations, which could be supplemented by mods that fleshed out these systems a lot more. M&B:W provided a wonderful base for other, better versions of the game to exist.I think that's where Bannerlord is at now. It's an improved version of vanilla warband, with cool systems, improved graphics, and new features, but it's still just that: upgraded warband. Did you like vanilla? This is a really fun game. Were you like me and most of your time was spent in some mod or another? This is still a really fun game, but it's still vanilla, so until the modding tools come out, you're SOL if you want something more substantial than the usual gameplay cycle.Original Review below==============================This is a really hard review to write considering I've been a massive fan of the series for years, have 500+ hours in warband (not as much as some, I know). Understand that I'm a single-player player, I don't care about multiplayer.I should mention that I have full faith in Taleworlds making this game what it has the potential to be - however I'm not reviewing the future.Pros:- After two days, the dev team has already released two major hotfixes that fix a lot of issues. If they keep this behavior up, I'm certain this game will be actually decent in as short as a month from now.- The game is stunning, the map is new and very pretty, and there are a lot of systems in place that weren't present in warband. It's also a lot bigger, and the economy is pretty cool, even if its not fully functional yet.- Apparently the modding is going to be absolutely crazy - we're getting actual mod support instead of just trying to decompile pyc files to actually mod things. Given how much warband modders were able to do, I'm super excited for the potential here.- The new systems that are in bannerlord are interesting, like getting to smelt your own weapons, do thievery / roguery, and the barter system. These systems fleshed out will be amazing.I won't mention the various bugs / crashes because they are likely going to be fixed here in the next week or so. Having 200k new testers tends to have a tendency to make things a little easier to bugfix. Some notable ones include: Archers not firing, softcap on the number of saves you can save before the file becomes corrupted, economy giving you 15K denars / day, all bandit hideouts crashing your game, etc etc etc.Cons:- The game has been in development for 8 years, and I'm wondering where it shows. Yes the game is gorgeous, but the lack of fleshed out systems, broken economy, bugs/crashes, and lack of basic systems like fief bartering, kingdom management, politics, many AI issues, etc. make me wonder exactly what all that time was spent doing. They have a custom built engine, but I'm on the side that says their subsidies from the Turkish government for the last decade have left them dragging their feet, and I'm afraid we're seeing the result of half-assed workmanship showing from it.- Many of the systems listed above aren't fully functional. Kingdom management isn't in yet, there are only about 10 quest types, and political diplomacy isn't really implemented.- I'm a little girl and am upset that there is no autoblock feature, although I expect this to be either modded in fairly soon or taleworlds will cave to the overwhelming pressure to add it back in.- Leveling is really slow compared to warband, and there are more strict hard-caps to your skills. Previously there was a skill which raised the hard cap for combat skills by like 70 or so per point invested? Now it raises it by 20 and you're still expected to reach 275+ proficiency on some things, even with the much slower leveling.- Combat is... slower? I can't really tell. It's different than in warband (same concepts though) and my muscle memory disagrees with it. It's not even the blocking feature honestly, there's just some delay. I think this is either because your skills start out very low and are also really slow to level, unlike warband where you also start very low but usually plateau in the 150 - 200 range for a skill, in general. This may just be the same system, but the perception is skewed because the highest level you can reasonably attain in a combat skill is like 70 (still out of like 300 mind you) or more realistically, 40 to 50. This slow combat feature also exists in warband, but doesn't matter as much because it evens out once you become proficient in a weapon. In bannerlord, you're never proficient in a weapon.- Level scaling is off for everything. As mentioned the hard caps above, basic farmer recruits will already have stats that outlevel your midgame character. My imperial recruits have something like 50 1H skill even though they're level 6, I'm sitting here at level 15 with my 1H skill hard capped at 40.With the lack of how well the game is actually fleshed out at this point I'd honestly recommend waiting a little, even a few weeks, before picking it up. It's not bad and I want its potential to grow, but there's still a fair amount of issues with it for now that I find myself going back to warband mods to find a fuller experience.\", helpful='741 people found this review helpful, 35 people found this review funny', rewards=0, hrs_on_record=92.6),\n",

Knowing that we stood the best chance of profiting during wartime, we ceased our retreat over hill and glen and turned to confront the pursuing enemy.  Though at a disadvantage, we met for a parley with their commander.\"We greatly outnumber you,\" he said, urging us to surrender. Disagreeing with his offer, we prepared for the battle.Archers to the rear, atop a hill for elevation and as a vantage point.Infantry, to the front! Form a line!Cavalry, to me!We stared down the wooded hillside and watched the enemy approach in mass.  Every now and then we would see their armor gleaming in the sunlight.\"Shieldwall!\" my hero cried. The front line closed the gaps between them and stood shoulder to shoulder. A rain of arrows pelted them, killing those that were to slow to raise their shields in time.Our archers returned fire with a volley of our own, the sound of bowstrings thrumming and the whistling of arrows flew overhead.Spotting the enemy commander as the army emerged from the treeline, my hero led our cavalry, though small in number, back around the hill and along the right flank of the enemy. They had no idea we were there.The sound of crashing steel and splintering wood echoed through the trees. We could not see the two armies as they crashed, but we heard the cries long before we saw them. There they were, the red uniforms of the Vladians were unmistakable against the verdant green of our Battanian horde. Their backs were turned to us as their archers fired up the hill that we had chosen as our refuge.\"CHARGE!\" my hero cried. Our mounted units quickly advanced into the line of attacking archers and cut many down in our first pass. Looking up the hill, I saw that the enemy had foolishly advanced into the waiting spears of our scorpion formation. Their numbers had immensely dwindled.My hero gave the order.  \"At them!\" he shouted. Our Battanian infantry broke their formation and charged down the hillside, using their momentum to run down the now retreating Imperials.  Among them was the enemy commander, urging his routed army to turn back and attack.Rallying the cavalry once more, we charged toward our prize.', helpful='85 people found this review helpful, 14 people found this review funny', rewards=31, hrs_on_record=49.6),\n",
       " SteamReview(text=\"The game is lacking some serious depth and feels shallow, besides the overhauled graphics and sieges it feels like just a reskin of Warbands singleplayer.- 10 to 15 generic sidequests that are copy and pasted throughout the entire game, for me personally I was most excited about the entire criminal underworld aspect, but that was just a shallow hub of repetitive quests/dialogue. -  Hardly any unique scenes, each nation has 2-3 designs for there towns, and 1-2 for there cities. All the bandit hideouts are identical and play out the exact same. All the taverns for each respective nation are identical etc etc.- All of the factions reuse armor assets from eachother. Feels like theres barely any armor variety- Hardly any depth added to dialogue. Lords all share almost identical dialogue with only slight differences here and there, companions are shallow, NPCs in towns you own won't acknowledge you as king, same goes for prisoners etc etc etc- Multiplayer has been watered down, with combat feeling clunkier (though some people prefer that feel.) and no customization allowed, along with way less game modes. (duel, battle, deatchmatch, CTF etc.) and hardly any maps.- Character progression in my opinion is quite poor. It is incredibly slow and things such as building up your clan take way to long.- The world just feels dead and empty. It doesn't react to your actions and feels lifeless- Lastly, all these issues are compounded by the fact that the game is ripe with bugs and crashes, however I imagine most of these will be ironed out as the game progresses. While none of these issues on their own are that big of a deal, it does add up and leave me wondering where they spent the last 5 years of development. Mods in warband, such as PoP, add more depth to the world then Bannerlord. It just feels like a reskin of vanilla Warband with amazing sieges and a better character creation menu. I'm sure modding will be the saving grace for this game, but until then, I don't think this game is worth the 50$ price tag.\", helpful='116 people found this review helpful, 4 people found this review funny', rewards=1, hrs_on_record=26.6),\n",

       " SteamReview(text='My thumbs down review is based on 3 main things that I will break down a bit more to explain. Overall, I love the concept of this game and the promise of it but as it is and as it is currently being developed, I gotta give this a thumbs down. So two main points:1: This game has, is, and will be in early access till Christ himself comes back as far as I can tell. This game has taken somewhere close of 7 years just to get to early access and now it\\'s been in Early Access for over a year and what game did we get for all this dev time? An Unplayable mess is what we all got. Campaign has barely any features, has only the loosest and unfinished storyline that an indie developer could have done better, and even the multiplayer is bare bones, at best. All in all, this game feels like something still in Alpha stages compared to others and it\\'s been 8 YEARS. Bethesda takes less time and comes up with a somewhat more completed game. Or at least they used to. Anyway, point for this one is, they don\\'t do anything to actually get this game to release levels of quality. Since it\\'s come out almost all of the main features of the game are STILL incomplete from the character creation to the story line to the clan management, UNLESS YOU USE MODS, which brings me to point 2.2.) The mods are the only reason, and only way, to play this game in any kind of enjoyable way. You want to be a hireling and be a simple soldier to work your way up the ranks? Need a mod. Want to simply make a character not look like a patato person with fat clay lumps for limbs? Mod it baby! Want to be able to manage the clan you started and actually run it like a proper kingdom? I submit to you, a MOD. Want to edit your friggin banner so it doesn\\'t look like everyone elses and also have the actual icons of said banner be properly aligned on your shields and banners in BANNER lord? You get a mod, and you get a mod, and YOU get a mod! Have I made my point yet? Nope, it needs a friggin MOD TOO! In all seriousness though, this game is un-fun and barely playable WITHOUT mods. Early Access? More like too early to tell. Without mods and the hero\\'s who have been modding this game despite all of the mechanisms to do so being locked, this game is still far from being playable IMO and that\\'s a HUGE problem! Beyond that though it seems as if TW is perfectly fine with this situation as they essentially RELY on modders to do more development of their game than they do! Which leads me to point #3 in my \"what the %$@# TW?!\" rant.3.) They aren\\'t even developing their friggin game! Want to know what the latest patch does? it fixes bugs...I found 29 mentions of the word BUG throughout the patchnotes and almost as many mentions of the words FIXED and CRASH but you know what I didn\\'t find? Additional content. I expect bug fixes, hell Nioh 2 still hands out some bug fixes and their game is actually finished and a year or two old without competitive multiplayer. but here\\'s the thing, TW still has to finish this game, or so they say. they patch their game like a company that has already finished the thing and is just maintaining it but it ISN\\'T FINISHED folks, and not by a looooong shot. They added 4 new armors and some physics to reins some very minor additions to the campaign map, incredibly small changes to quests such as making your brother finally act like every other npc in the game, by the way that one was fixed by a mod back at the beginning of the year, and this recent patch is just the latest in a long line of tiny-little-itty-bitty changes to the game at a time. This game will never be done at this rate, it just won\\'t. to sum it all up, don\\'t buy this game unless you want to spend hours figuring out the mods you want, downloading them off of Nexus, which is having it\\'s own issues pissing off the modding community now, and then figure out which ones even work anymore because without the mods, this game is DEFINITELY not worth the price. Unless you come across a sale making htis thing $10 or less, don\\'t do it. Save your money, spend it on games that actually get finished, and just come and check on this in another year or two. Maybe then some actual progress will be made. P.S. I\\'m not mad...I\\'m just very disappointed.', helpful='503 people found this review helpful, 28 people found this review funny', rewards=62, hrs_on_record=277.7),\n",

       " SteamReview(text=\"For the multiplayer and combat, I cannot recommend the game. I'll be brief because of character limit. I tested the alpha/beta for about 900 hours.Gamemodes are scarce, customization is totally absent, combat is bad, balance non-existent, developer response to feedback abysmal. The main characteristic of Mount & Blade's combat is being highly skill based, 'easy to learn, hard to master'. In Warband the mechanics were simple, but the way they could be manipulated by the player offered a huge degree of freedom, and separated new players from skilled veterans. You could play for 100 hours and get a good idea of the combat dynamics, but you'd need thousands of hours of practice to truly master the combat system and compete against the most experienced players. In Bannerlord, on the other hand, combat mechanics aren't simple but totally overcooked, with multiple unnecessary variables that go into calculating everything from stuns to movement speed, these variables offer zero control to both casual and competitive players alike, and all they do is add a feeling of randomness and inconsistency, which combined with the game's mechanical functioning (with the animations, for instance), and the pile of present issues, do not allow the combat to have nearly as much control and freedom, and as a consequence the skill ceiling is absolutely remote from Warband. Essentially, you could pit a relatively new player against a pro and the new player would have good chances of beating him, because the current combat does not allow the player to use their skill and experience to the full, or even an acceptable extent.  It's littered with issues, which we have been pointing out in closed tests for about 10 months and yet they are still present. There are many contextual problems — for instance damage to horses from up close being totally negligible while becoming extremely high with speed bonus — however I will quickly skim through the issues of the core mechanics to avoid writing an essay. Movement is horrible, it's floaty and sluggish, it feels like you're dragging your character around any time you change directions due to acceleration issues, and on top of that the way 'momentum' acts makes it often feel like you're sliding around the place or 'ice skating'. Acceleration to top speed on the other hand is extremely quick, and deceleration to combat speed (combat speed is a lower movement speed that kicks in when you do any combat action like blocking or preparing an attack) is very slow, combat speed is slightly too high, and the strafing/backpedaling speed ratio isn't quite right, which mixed with the issues above makes it so that you'll often find yourself fighting players constantly sliding around you spamming or attacking you and immediately moving out of your range. Bear in mind that movement could be fixed with a few parameter changes but nothing has been done in all these months of beta. The stun timings are off, which in turn means that the rhythm of combat is off — to briefly explain how it works, if I parry an attack, I will have a stun duration which prevents me from attacking until it's over (it's very short), similarly if I attack, I will need a short time to recover before I can attack again — the current timings make it so that the defender has a very large window to respond to an attack, while the attacker can't recover very quickly, essentially you cannot put pressure on the enemy by punishing them for poor reactions or trying to get a 2nd hit in with the correct positioning, since they will always have enough time, even if they react very late, to attack you back. This transforms the combat in a stale hit-block-hit-block sequence which goes on forever. On top of that, stuns are extremely inconsistent because they are calculated using a large variety of totally unnecessary physical factors, so one time you could get a short stun, and another a much longer stun, and you can never really tell when that is going to happen. Shield blocking is directional, blocking in the right direction will make your shield receive less damage, however you receive so much less of it that even blocking correctly by mistake will essentially make your shield last forever. You could block for 30 minutes straight while waiting for your team to come help you, again something that could be fixed with one number change. The speed to ready an attack is incredibly sluggish, it feels like to prepare an attack or to switch between multiple directions it takes ages, similarly blocking speed is noticeably slow and this could get you killed particularly when using heavier weapons no matter how quickly you react, all of this makes combat feel totally unresponsive. The arcs of swings are huge, you could hit someone almost behind you, this inevitably incentivizes spam as one way or the other you'll end up catching the opponent in one of your wide swings. Furthermore, glances are not animation based as they are in Warband (meaning, too early in the attack animation your attack will always glance off), but they are damage based, which however means that they're completely inconsistent and you will find yourself almost never glancing simply because you go over the damage threshold. This means that you could hit someone when your swing has barely even started, leaving them no time to react. Feints are garbage, mostly because of how long it takes to switch from one attack to the other, however if you sped this up, because of the way the animations smoothly transition into each other, they would become op as it would be impossible for the player to understand when one attack ended and the other begun, moreover because of these transitions at the moment your feints can go through a player's blocks or body making it look like it was a real attack. This could be fixed by making the transitions between animations break up just a little more, but of course nothing has been done. The balance between different attacks is off, right swings offer you the highest range but they're also faster and the easiest to hit with reliably. Chained attacks (essentially combos, chaining one attack into the next) are useless, they're actually slower than performing 2 normal consecutive attacks, this mechanic makes absolutely zero sense right now. Chambers (countering an opponent's attack with another attack) are broken, they require your weapons to physically touch to happen, this requires a precision that no player can ever achieve, on top of that the timings are so unreliable that chambers only ever happen by mistake. Kicks are equally useless, the stun after kicking is never long enough to follow up with a hit, so you're essentially exposing yourself for nothing. There is a stance system in the game, meaning your attacks will be slightly faster if you're in the correct stance (left or right), at this point it's still unclear if they also have any other effects, however stances are controlled with your movement keys (moving right or left) which entails that you will never be able to use them correctly, as to use stances you will be forced to disregard your footwork which is extremely important. Essentially, everyone fights without thinking about them and it adds to the feeling of randomness and inconsistency.I'd write more if not for character limit, but essentially for the whole beta duration it felt like talking to a brick wall, barely any changes were made, even changes that only required 1 number tweak, and it felt like we were being almost completely ignored. They didn't even bother to give us a proper environment to test the game such as duel mode, so we had to resort to community mods to test their game to give them feedback. Practically, a waste of time. I cannot recommend the game at the moment until the developers get their ♥♥♥♥ together, start listening, and start fixing the game.\", helpful='366 people found this review helpful, 18 people found this review funny', rewards=2, hrs_on_record=341.9),\n",

       " SteamReview(text='In its current state Bannerlord is practically a mediocre remake of Warband in a new engine. For a sequel it\\'s downright disappointing, especially after all these years of delays and promises of evolved gameplay in their dev blog posts which just didn\\'t happen. This might change before it leaves early access but none of the developer comments so far, including the steam page \"roadmap\", indicate any plans for major changes to the gameplay or overall design, and that is something that Bannerlord desperately needs. So the only fair thing is to judge it as it is now, the product they are now selling, instead of something that might, but probably won\\'t, happen down the line. Which in short is why I am not recommending it, and a more detailed breakdown of the issues follows. If the game changes enough in the future I will update the review accordingly.Almost every part of the game is plagued by simply bad and frustrating design, unsatisfying progression, technical or balancing issues or simply lack of content. While it has many UI and graphical improvements over Warband, the gameplay has actually worsened in most cases. The best part of the game is combat, and I imagine that\\'s mostly because it barely changed compared to warband, it just looks and feels better. Party and inventory management has improved, an attempt has been made to improve player character progression which failed by their own admission and is pending a rework, but except for that it is still basically the same thing. For some people that might be enough, but if that is all they set out to accomplish this should have indeed been labeled as just a remaster rather than a sequel.Most of the teased new features of the game are underdeveloped, badly designed or completely irrelevant. The trait system that affects diplomacy is nothing more than just a small adjustment to relations based on a few nonsensical, randomly assigned, traits everyone gets (which also applies instantly to newborns that are labeled as \"honorable\" or \"cruel\" on their birth and remain as such forever - even medieval total war 2 from 14 years ago had a more indepth system). The criminal system they teased many times is practically nonexistent and just boils down to a few quests you can accept. NPC permadeath is just an annoyance and doesn\\'t serve any larger purpose, or has real consequences - if anything, it just means that instead of memorable NPCs from the first game like Jeremus, now we have procedurally generated blank slates with generic names that sometimes literally write a placeholder \"(Generic backstory)\" when met for the first time. There is no succession systems, no unique interactions for killing someone\\'s family, it is just there to delete an NPC from a game and eventually replace it with a generic randomized one. The dialogue trees are literally copy pasted from warband, word for word, except they somehow have even fewer options now since some have been removed. Smithing is an exercise in frustration whose only goal is to completely break the economy because a single crafted javelin can be priced at more than an entire city\\'s market worth. Sieges are still broken, have bad AI, units constantly get stuck and siege engines didn\\'t really add that much to the whole experience at all, they are mostly just something you use on the world map to reduce enemy defenses before the actual siege. I could list dozens of other examples, from a worse tournament system, worse faction diplomacy, a disappointing settlement upgrade system that doesn\\'t do anything in the end despite them initially promising a more sandboxy strategic experience (it is just a prettier warband sistem with 0 innovation or meaningful changes), as bad kingdom management systems as in warband, a frustrating whack-a-mole endgame gameplay where you alone have to both conquer and defend fiefs because everyone else is incompetent and you can\\'t issue complex or remote orders, the constant running of errands for lords to grind up reputation and then chasing them around the map in circles because the only info you have is where they were days ago, not where they are going, etc etc.Since release most of TW\\'s time has been dedicated to patching bugs, optimizing the game and doing code refactors which are apparently already necessary since they rushed the EA release. The modding tools are still not out yet and it doesn\\'t seem like that leaves a lot of time to rework core gameplay or add more content before the end of early access which they estimated will last only a year. So in the end, we have a game that didn\\'t add anything new and meaningful to the franchise - it just badly copied the original, but added improved graphics and made promises of better mod support that hasn\\'t happened yet.Oh and multiplayer? It is already practically dead, queues are extremely long and for some bigger modes like siege it is impossible to find a game at all.If this changes down the line, I will gladly change the review to a positive one. As it is however, I do not recommend it at this point - you\\'re better off playing Warband again. I hope they are not planning to pull a Bethesda and just hope the community fixes their mess for free once the modding tools are out, because some of these issues are beyond mods, even extensive ones that warband has.', helpful='603 people found this review helpful, 25 people found this review funny', rewards=91, hrs_on_record=27.4),\n",

       " SteamReview(text='This game reminds me a lot of Crusader Kings 3.Both M&B Bannerlord and CK3 are sequels to highly successful games, milestones in their respective genres. With this huge shoes to fill, both Bannerlord and CK3 choose to improve graphics and user experience, over reworking the complex mechanics of their predecessors. There\\'s reason why both M&B Warband and Crusader Kings 2 are, arguably, \"better games\".Still, I have high hopes both for CK3 and M&B Bannerlord, I believe that a graphical update was needed, and that both long time players and newcomers can enjoy the new games. We old timers can always go back to the old school if we really want to, I still play CK2 and Warband.Other aspect that brings both games together is the huge and dedicated modding scene that the prequels have. I have high hopes for the Bannerlord modding scene, but I\\'ve read that TaleWorlds updating of the game has broken many mods. Hopefully the game\\'ll reach a more stable state that\\'ll allow the modders to work. I\\'m really looking forward to some mods, like Kingdom Come or Paris Commune.To anyone interested, the single player game is playable in Linux via Proton/Wine, but the multiplayer doesn\\'t on account of Battl Eye Anti Cheat being incompatible with the Linux kernel.

Dating back to practically the game\\'s release, over 1 year ago at time of writing.

       " SteamReview(text='I\\'m gonna go ahead and say that I am enjoying the Singleplayer a lot. But there are loads of issues that need to be dealt with in this game. Yeah it\\'s in early acces but that doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t criticize the game/suggest changes. Saying \"don\\'t compare it to warband\" is just dumb. I think it\\'s perfectly fine to compare the two games. Bannerlord is the sequel to Warband after all. It\\'s supposed to improve on the previous game. If  I see something as a step down from Warband, then I will obviously have to compare it to Warband. This review is on how the game is as it stands right now and the problems I ran into playing it soon after launch.-The movement just feels very floaty. It\\'s honestly hard to explain what is wrong with it. But it just feels fundamentally wrong. Turning feels slower and not as \\'reactive\\' as Warband.-Horrible FPS on siege maps. I can run the game fine on medium settings with 500 units in normal battles. But on sieges it just drops down an insane amount. I have to turn units down to 200 to get 60ish fps on singleplayer.-Loads of crashes. I\\'ve luckily only experienced one in the early access myself. But some of my friends have had constant crashes.-Quickblocking seems to be impossible with how the delays between actions work. (not sure as I can\\'t properly test it on my own server)-Battering rams and Siege Towers seem to go down a bit too easily. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but I feel like they could be rebalanced a bit.-You Bounce off armor without the other person getting stunned. (opponent can hit regardless of if he got hit first, if he has enough armor). I know this is more realistic but competitively speaking it\\'s horrible. As it rewards people for not even trying to block the other persons attacks, and just spamming and hoping the armor takes the hit.-I personally don\\'t like the melee that much. This could also be because I have to get used to it, coming from warband. But, everything feels sluggish and less smooth than warband\\'s melee did. I feel like this has something to do with the animations. It reminds me a bit of the Holdfast melee, which was horribleThe Multiplayer feels extremely dumbed down. Now, I understand that this wasn\\'t the main focus of the developers. But it\\'s a huge part of the game for me, as someone who played 3000 hours of Warband Multiplayer it is what I will continue playing after I\\'ve done a couple singleplayer campaigns.-No Dedicated Servers yet. This is the biggest issue with the game for me. No servers = No clans, teams or whatever you want to call them. People can\\'t host events, practice with their teams, do tournaments, just ♥♥♥♥ about together, create weird gamemodes on their private servers etc.-No freedom in picking your armor and weaponry. The only thing you can change is stuff like \"better armor\" \"mace instead of sword\". 3 slots with 2 options each. This HAS to be changed-The server kicks you after ONE round is done-You can\\'t make different characters for multiplayer, with different names, faces and banners. Again, for teams or clans this would be great-Parties for matchmaking are only 6 people-Identical factions versus each other constantly (Sturgia v Sturgia, Khuzait v Khuzait)-Server limit of 64 is on the small side(it\\'s fine because of the current fps issues on siege)-Team damage needs to be on in sieges. Currently, if you\\'re in a 3v1 the enemies can just spam their attacks and constantly stun you because there is no risk of hitting their teammates. People don\\'t need to think about when they should attack-Servers go down quite a bit-The campaigns seem to go by too quickly. One or two factions will snowball at the start. At which point the AI just goes ham and starts sieging castle after castle. This results in extremely quick campaigns, 30 hours ingame and I\\'ve conquered the whole map. I think I sieged around 10 castles myself, in total. The AI is extremely agressive and barely leaves anything for the player. -All factions\\' units are the exact same stats-wise (Vlandian tier 5 has same stats as Sturgian tier 5) This removes any flavour from the factions. In Warband, Nords had best Shield Inf. Rhodoks best Cbow. Swadians best heavy cav. Khergit best horse archers. Etc. This made the factions more interesting.-Every faction has horse archers, every faction has shield inf. etc. Again, it would add more flavour to the game if it actually mattered where you got your recruits/where you started. F.e. if Khuzait have horse archers. But the rest of the factions don\\'t have them. And the Sturgians have massive shields Inf while the Khuzaits have no good inf. Instead of that, the Khuzaits have everything, the Empire has everything, everyone pretty much has nearly everything. This also makes the factions feel more bland and less interesting.-There are loads of repeating Villages/Battle Scenes. I\\'ve seen a handful of villages across the whole map. There seems to be no random map generation like in Warband for battle scenes. Which just means you\\'re constantly fighting on the same maps. This makes the battles a lot more boring in a prolonged campaign. This is just a step down from warband.-Very Little variation in armor and weaponry. I went to 4 big towns and they sold the exact same armor and weapons. Yes, they were all of the same faction, but there should be some variation/unique stuff here and there. In Warband you had quality tiers like \"rusty\" \"great\" etc. this would help the game a lot in adding more variation. This is another step down from Warband-500 days in, I was level 15 and the game was almost done. There have barely been any character upgrades I have been able to do so far. You can never get far within skill trees (The highest skill I have is like 120)-Siege engines: The biggest problem with this feature is that the enemy siege engines on the overworld map can just vanish your tier 6 units like it\\'s nothing. If the enemy siege equipment randomly hits your army, they can kill 5 Elite Cataphract units that you spent 100 days on training. This can happen multiple times during a single siege and just makes it so I never want to use the trebuchets/onagers/balistas-It seems that pretty much all of the lords of a defeated faction join the faction that defeated them. This feeds into the snowballing problem-Raiding rewards very little money for how long it takes. It\\'s good for food. But some more loot would be nice. Slight rebalance/tweak would be good-Influence edicts that give you -1 influence can stack up and make it so you have no way to retain influence. If you join a faction late into the game that has already passed some -1 influence edicts you can get stuck on this. You need more influence to be able to obtain influence. But anything you gain is lost within a day or two because it\\'s constantly deducting 2,3 or 4 influence a day. This isn\\'t impossible to deal with, but it can just get your campaign stuck for a while-Loads of little quest bugs-Loot from tournaments is not that good. Apart from that one OP axe, there isn\\'t really anything special in there-The AI seems extremely reluctant to make peace, even if the other faction has no castles or armies left. -Why are Bandit hideouts still as bad as in warband. Incredibly disappointing- The AI seems to want to give you castles that are close to your other castles. Which I don\\'t really like, as the AI sometimes gives you castles you don\\'t want. In my game, I got a Khuzait fief really early on, but then couldn\\'t expand further because all of the surrounding lands were already given to other lordsThis is a very long list, even though I took some stuff out (steam word limit), but I have good hope that the developers will fix many of these issues. If this were to happen, I\\'ll change this review into a thumbs up in stead.', helpful='70 people found this review helpful, 3 people found this review funny', rewards=0, hrs_on_record=55.4),\n",
       " SteamReview(text=\"Been a week now so quick update:Singleplayer gets changed alot. Daily, relevent patches. TW doing a good job with that. Multiplayer is still the same mess. No gameplay changes, just some crash fixes. Atleast the qeue and server issues are gone for now. Apparently they're working on a new gamemode, which won't do much currently unless it comes with a working matchmaking/mmr system so new players don't have to face veterans all the time.---------I'd really like to reccomend this game to other people, but I just can't currently.I've been playing Warband since 2012 competetively and won a bunch of tournaments. I've also been playing the alpha and beta version of the game.While the game does indeed have improved graphics everything else is a huge let-down. They told us EA is expected to last for about 1 year which is quite disappointing after 8 years of developement.There's a ton of performance problems and it seems to be impossible for Windows7 users to play multiplayer (Fixed in e.1.0.2).----The Singleplayer has lots of bugs in it. I fully understand that this is just Early Access and bugs are to be expected (singleplayer was not playable during alpha and beta) but the amount of bugs is not acceptable. From random objects in Cities to AIs that all stack up on one place just to do nothing. The fact that you can only use 6 colours while creating your own banner is a straight up joke, this is not 2010. There's still no proper tutorial to the singleplayer showing and explaining you stuff. The AI is very weird. Some 'boss' NPCs can put up a pretty decent fight, but most looter and regular units make the same mistakes as in warband which makes it extremly boring for me. I'm more of a PVP guy anyway, but I'd atleast expect some AI improvement. You can still run away on a horseback and stab behind you and all of the dismounted units will follow you and run into your hits. Overall the singeplayer now has more features which is nice, but nothing that justifies 8 years of developement. In addition there's also a bunch of quests that are not doable and some bugs that will make your game crash (reaching a certain year/day in the campaign). ---The Multiplayer is a complete mess. Warbands easy to learn - hard to master, skillrewarding combat was completly thrown out of the window. The entire combat got slowed down and leaves a player with barely any ways to kill an opponent. Between decent players most 1v1 fights therefore consist of boring hit block hit block combat. All of the maps from skirmish have massive bugs that let you just walk out of the map etc, which got reported but not fixed.Bannerlord multiplayer has no proper tutorial for any gamemode. All there's for new players is a brief description of the mode. The new class system isn't explained either. The old economy system which gave a player so much freedom was removed.The balancing is awful, shields last forever if you use directional blocking, archers can shoot below almost every shield in the game easily, spears have a hard time stopping cav due to it's hitbox, couchlancing is permanent and has no cooldown, most perks in the game are quite useless, the list doesn't end. The last few updates before EA have not addressed anything balance or combat related. The current 'matchfinder' makes it hard for newer players to enjoy multiplayer as most matches are straight up not balanced and result in a stomp (especially with beta players playing). The qeue still appears to be buggy not letting you find a game altough there's over 200 people searching.  Leaving an active match has no punishment so lot's of the matches you play (skirmish) end up not finishing 6v6. I reckon alot of people will not bother with skirmish unless this gets improved soon.All of these things were pointed out during the beta, but TW barely responded to feedback threads.Hope this gets improved alot and very soon otherwise I don't see the MP developing a proper scene.Will try to update this review during EA.\", helpful='157 people found this review helpful, 9 people found this review funny', rewards=0, hrs_on_record=127.6),\n",

       " SteamReview(text='This is more of a \"mixed\" review than a negative, sadly there isn\\'t the option for that.Mound and Blade II: Bannerlord is, as its core, a unique experience. You control groups of soldiers in tactical battles against soldiers from enemy factions, from a few men on each side to hundreds on each side. Outside of battles, you move between towns or places in the \"overworld map,\" as other parties do their own thing from various factions. You can trade, purchase goods or weapons and such in towns or settlements, do mercenary work for a Kingdom or eventually join one. You have a lot of options, and it does its job well as a sandbox experience. You level up over time and can specialize in various areas - such as trading, tactics, charm, or in the use of various kinds of combat (like one-handed weapons vs bows). It is a weird cross between sandbox simulation of Kingdoms, tactical 3rd or 1st person battles, and RPG.However, in its current state, the game is extremely unfinished and broken in many ways.The battle AI leaves a lot to be desired, especially when fighting as only a small part of an army and controlling only a fraction of the soldiers. I have repeatedly controlled the \"archery\" detachment of soldiers when fighting for the Southern Empire, and friendly infantry will randomly retreat or behave as though your troops do not exist - without warning - leaving you to die. When attacking a castle, your troops will break down the gate with a battering ram, only to run away from it and try to go up siege towers or ladders instead - while the enemy troops sit inside the gate in a square formation and just stand still as you kill them. If you run in front of a group of your archers - such as when raiding bandit hideouts - enemy units or archers will mostly exclusively target you, letting your archers easily mop up. There are many other issues like these which break my immersion and trivialize combat.On the larger scale, diplomacy is non-existent, and the only way to reliably raise your standing with various lords is to support them in votes for Kingdom decisions. Or when that isn\\'t possible - doing a tiny selection of boring side quests that give very little benefit. You can\\'t really do much to easily get people to like you, and even when they do there\\'s very little reason to do so. To convince people to help you, you often do a \"charm mini-game\" where your chances of winning or losing are simplified percentage chances and you have to win multiple times, often leading you to fail to convince people despite it making no sense that they would say no in any reasonable world.Trading is utterly broken (early-on especially), because you can have hundreds of mules and horses in your party for carrying capacity and speed without any real penalty, and bandits don\\'t have any way of ambushing you or grouping up to get you when they know you have valuable goods. Trade of course is enjoyable to an extent as it follows a decent framework (buy low in towns/cities, sell high in places of high demand), but it needs a lot of work.What made me stop playing the game however was a completely broken part of the game: Kingdom management.Right now, the only way to make your own Kingdom is by doing an excruciatingly boring main quest that has you running around the world map hunting down random people to talk to. This would be bad enough, but once you have formed that Kingdom - it is literally broken. You have no option to declare war on other nations directly, as the option is grayed out, so you can\\'t really obtain land in any meaningful way. You can raid a village...angering the village inhabitants, to declare war instead - yet when I did this earlier, the game hit me with a 300 influence loss out of nowhere. Which takes a very long time to build up, and is used for forming armies with other parties and many other important things you need for a Kingdom.I can forgive technical issues. Such as missing tooltips, skills that do not work, and terrible balance in many areas. I understand that this game is in Early Access, and that it will take time to improve it. In its current state though, there are entire major functions of the game that simply do not work, and countless exploits and poorly thought out features (such as bandit camp raids) that take away from the enjoyment of the game. Some of these were fixed by mods within hours or days of the game coming out into Early Access as well, and for a game that has been in development for years, I find this to be a bit disappointing.Still, I mostly enjoyed the 30+ hours I put into it. I can\\'t comment much on the multiplayer, but it seemed okay for what little I tried. If you don\\'t mind the game being extremely buggy and lacking major important features, it might be worth picking up. But my personal recommendation is to wait until the game has had more time to develop, as right now it feels in many ways like it is too early to even be in the Early Access stage.', helpful='83 people found this review helpful, 16 people found this review funny', rewards=0, hrs_on_record=36.1),\n",
       " SteamReview(text=\"Only thing that is fully finished in this game is the combat system. Then again, combat is exactly the same as in the previous installments. That means that ranged is the best option again. Archers (especially on horses) just destroy everything, infantry and cavalry are unfeasible; cavalry especially.Grind is fun at first (as it always is in M&B games), but once you get to mid-late game everything feels like a placeholder, early game content quickly becomes a chore. AI in big battles is retarded, enemy is ALWAYS on the defensive, always tries to form that stupid suicide circle, both allies and enemies (sometimes at the same time in the same battle). So large skirmishes become unfun, unless everyone just charges (which is an extremely rare occurrence) cuz AI can't be tactical, it just dances around and does the freaking circle thing. And yeah, AI knows that archers are the best too so tries to win all battles with just ranged, like I mentioned charges happen once in a blue moon.Campaign map AI... Don't even get me  started. If you become a vassal\\\\merc, your faction will declare war on someone (to keep you entertained I guess) and will move its' stupid armies to siege some backwater castle. Don't ever join those armies since they're slow and unpurposeful (they constantly forget where they were going and change their targets) + they eat the food you have stored (guess lords can't do their grocery shopping on their own). If you finally reach a castle and seize it, another faction that has borders with yours will declare war on your dudes within a couple of days. And your faction won't be able to hold their own on two fronts - this stupid fсkery will continue until at least one castle is taken back by someone, then everyone will declare peace for a month or so, and the cycle will continue.As for sieges - these were never good in M&B so I guess nothing of value was lost. Nothing was gained either, new siege mechanics don't seem to work well - it's just a giant moshpit in front of the ladder all over again.Whether you are fighting for someone, or have your own kingdom, defeating and capturing enemy lords individually in order to weaken their faction is pointless - they will always escape captivity and come back after 2-3 days with a full party of leveled up troops to fight you again. You can chop their fсking heads off and kill them for good, but this will ruin your relationship with EVERYONE making diplomacy even more useless than it is. Oh, it will also mess with your recruitment since apparently killing your enemies makes you dishonorable and the majority of notables are the opposite of that - they won't like you anymore.Peace treaties do not work - you pay them around 75k-100k for peace (at all times) and they declare war on you again after a couple of days (talk about dishonorable, those pricks), they just don't care. Diplomacy is non-existent.The way to play that game right now is to get 200 horse archers and just KILL EVERYONE. Siege a castle (no need to take it even), wait till they come running, isolate parties one by one, crush them in battle, capture lords, chop their heads. Rinse and repeat, until there is no one left to oppose you. While you are drowning the countryside in blood, might as well capture all the settlements that you can.But what's the point of ruling over this cardboard Calradia? I'd rather leave it to the looters.TL DR: most mechanics are promising, but currently work poorly and are rather shallow. After a while, you just see how lame everything really is.Mods break after almost every update.And yeah, graphics look good and seem optimized. Sometimes, there are visual glitches tho.After so much time in development and all those updates... I don't know man. I guess I expected more.\", helpful='158 people found this review helpful, 10 people found this review funny', rewards=10, hrs_on_record=98.1),\n",
       " SteamReview(text=\"The Good the Bad and the Damn right Ugly. (short edition)Firstly I'm a die hard mount and blade fan and have been watching this closely for a long time now. I'm currently playing the game and have put 24 hours in already! Sad right.. but I enjoy the game style so much.The Good - - Exactly what we wanted, a mount and blade game they did not try and become something they are not.- Good foundation to build upon- Not as many bugs as there could be.The Bad -- The bugs that do exist are game breaking- Nothing new, same old features we loved, however nothing new or expanded. Re-skin of warband at the moment.- Lack of depth in ALL the features.The Ugly - - 8 year's development? Laughable release. Either they went through a new lead every half year or the current leadership have never made a game before.- Absolutely zero depth. The game lacks any real content apart from the usual and expected. The game draws you in with a beautiful start and raises your hope only to drop kick you directly in the scrotum when you look under the hood. (nothing to master).- Serious bugs that turn 14 hour saves into junk. I mean did they even play test their own game?Conclusion?This is a Pish poor excuse for a mount and blade game in 2020. The development team should be ashamed of what they have released even for early access. I seriously believe a team of 20 kids fresh out from university with 12 months and a limited budget could produce a better more feature rich game than this. This game makes me heart cry since I know this game is still years away from being what it should be now in early access.You should only buy this game is you have money to waste. Otherwise save yourself some money and wait 2-3 years when they release what I think they hoped to release. Due to budget reasons, staff issues, talent problems or what ever pathetic reason taleworlds have it's most of all a shame.As long as the company does not go bust I'm sure after a few years it will be good enough to be early access. Then modders can take over and make the game what it should have been.\", helpful='170 people found this review helpful, 5 people found this review funny', rewards=2, hrs_on_record=117.5),\n",

       " SteamReview(text=\"With Over 100 hours I feel safe to write a review of the game. Majority of the Thumbs up reviews are certainly biased, they just love the game because of what is is and not what it has.First thing first. The game itself has several horrible issues.  I highly recommend if you are in this group to wait and not buy. Reasons being that the game has known to use up to 16gb of Ram and running with graphic issues with GeForce 1060's. If you are in my boat and have a high end system you should be fine.Next. The game is very very barebones with the devs locking features/items, and key ideas that they put forth for development are not in the game yet. Some examples of systems not in the game or are not completed. Sandbox(none campaign), The main storyline, running your own kingdom, perks are a mess, xp gains broken, children/spouses/family. The content they do have is repetitive and lacking, and most of the time breaks.THE few things the game has going for it are the graphics, combat, and battles. The game is very pretty, even with the occasional glitch. The combat system is more refined and feels fluid. Finally the best part are the battles. With no mods and a good PC you can get battles of up to 1000 soldiers which fills the massive map. You can run strategies and different maneuvers. You can also set the body count to unlimited which in the end feels much like a real battle, it is epic.As much as I love the game, it is not really ready for EA let alone being $45.

       " SteamReview(text='I\\'ve had steam for about 10 years and never posted a review. I will do it for the first time, as the Mount & Blade series is one I hold dear. Is it a bad game? No, it\\'s average. In fact, if you\\'ve never played any Mount & Blade, you\\'re probably going to have fun. If you\\'re a fan, wait for a few years and then get it, but don\\'t expect to be blown away, due to certain key elements that are flawed.I have played 41 hours as of today, 2 weeks after the release of the Early Access Game. I do understand many issues will eventually get balanced out, such as the economy, unit strength, etc. Some other features will also eventually be released: dialogues, quests, new weapons, etc. I have played Mount & Blade I + Warband for about 200 hours. I will keep in mind that I’m reviewing the Early Access Version of the game. Let\\'s put certain things straight: first of all, TaleWorlds is *not* a small indie studio. According to Wikipedia, they had sold over 6 mio. copies of Mount & Blade as of 2015 (can\\'t find more recent figures), and about 100 people list TaleWorlds as their current employer on Linkedin. About 300 people state they were hired at some point by TaleWorlds according to the same source. If you don\\'t agree with me, feel free to write down what is your definition of small indie studio. Second of all: this game is not the first of a franchise, meaning you\\'re don\\'t need to imagine it from the ground off as a developer. I do understand that they restarted the development of their game engine at some point, but even then you don\\'t restart from scratch, as you already have defined many key elements that can be reused, such as graphics, sounds, story line, etc.The biggest let down for me is that it didn\\'t live up to its hype. If you don\\'t agree with me and you have bought the game yourself, look at this 2015 Gamescon video and tell me that you really see the amount of work put into the game for the past 5 years (!) - I enjoyed it enough to play it for like 40 hours. Again, it\\'s not a horrible game. - Easy learning curve: if you\\'ve never played Mount & Blade, you can learn really quickly by yourself. Else, it took me no more than 1 hour to learn the new mechanics.- Forgiving game: I use to play quite a lot of games every single day, but now I usually don\\'t play more than 2 hours a week. I enjoy that you don\\'t need to be a hardcore gamer to appreciate this game. If you make a mistake, it\\'s not game over: worst case scenario you lose a bit of time, but nothing too harsh. You can play, take a break and it won\\'t break the immersion either. - It’s a bit expensive, but I still find it reasonable, as long as all bugs get fixed soon. I will only list here items that I feel aren\\'t patchable / won\\'t be there upon full release. - Tactics: in battle, the AI will either run straight towards you, or will form a shield wall and wait. There are no tactics involved. That\\'s basically what the AI has been doing in the franchise since the first Mount & Blade. If they couldn\\'t program something better in 10 years of development, they will not be able to make it in the next 1-2 years. The enemy will never try to flank you, encircle you or outmanoeuvre you. TaleWorlds has never been able to create good AI, ever, and I don’t see how it would before full relase. - Battles: it\\'s fun up to a point. You will quickly realize that with an army composed of as many horsemen as possible, you will steamroll any enemy. Just charge as soon as the enemy army is within 200 paces and you\\'re set. You will have no issues destroying armies 5 times your size. Given that you will have dozen of battles per hour at some point, it get super boring. - From their 2015 press release: \"Improved storytelling with voice acting and motion captured dialogue\". Given the current written dialogues which are always the same ones, given the same animations we see over and over (for instance: when you capture multiple enemy lords after a battle), and given the current graphics and face animations, it\\'s not going to be good. - Sieges: it\\'s beautiful, but in the end, the AI doesn\\'t follow through and you don\\'t have the level of control needed to take care of it manually. You always end up with ladders not being used, soldiers just waiting in front of the gate while getting shot at, enemies going towards you and then will turn their back and do some random stuff while you kill them. It\\'s the same AI as Mount & Blade 1.- Game mechanics: that is probably the biggest issue. I could play the game to the fullest within an hour. All the mechanics were already there in Mount & Blade 1. There is nothing really new worth mentionin, except maybe siege weapons, but that gets stale quite quickly. It really felt like a remastered edition of Mount & Blade with a new map and a few new features. - Feels empty: I don\\'t think it\\'s super realistic that your army can fight 50 battles within 3 or 4 days of in game time, but that\\'s what you\\'re going to end up doing (that’s about as many battles as Napoleon in his whole life). The whole forging mechanism is fun for a bit, but it doesn\\'t really feel well thought through (why would a King spends days preparing charcoal in his basement? Why can\\'t any professional blacksmith do it better?) - There are other bugs and issues, but I won’t mention them here as I’m sure they will (or at least can) be fixed before full release. Get it if you\\'ve never played or if you want to take a trip down memory lane, but don\\'t expect any master piece. I will uninstall it now, but I will probably install it again next year to give it another try. For now, even if there are daily patches, it\\'s mostly bug fixing (crashes), i.e. nothing that will really make me keep trying the game. As a basic customer, I simply don’t see where TaleWorlds wasted so much time and where all the development time went for the past 10 years.', helpful='840 people found this review helpful, 62 people found this review funny', rewards=1, hrs_on_record=40.4),\n",

       " SteamReview(text='(before you read, let me tell you... i am genuinely pissed about the current state of the game but aware it will improve. this is just my opinion on what we have now. i do not intend to insult tale worlds, i just hope to give them some feedback and a much needed wake up call. this seems more like 1-2 years development not 5+!)Let me just start off by saying, this game franchise is by far my favourite franchise of all time. i played warband on xb1 for what must be over 1000 hours doing literally anything you can think of in the native game. When i found out there was a sequel in production i saved up and bought a pc just so i could play it...i got my pc about three years ago and played another 300+ hrs of viking conquest and mods... was it worth it...♥♥♥♥ no. this was... in the nicest way possible a complete let down, i am completely aware this game is only in early access  and will most likely be further developed into an acceptable sequel to warband. the fact that this has been in development for...god knows how long and this is the early access we was given really makes me wonder what they have been doing over at tale worlds. i will now list a few problems that i think are unacceptable. 1.performance issuesthe performance of this game is dreadful, i load into a battle against 10 looters with 10 men of my own and the game has a heart attack, maxing out at 10fps despite having the recommended system requirements. this is by far the biggest issue in the game and needs to be fixed asap.2. crashesi have crashed multiple times just doing the most simple things, such as leaving a tavern or waiting on the worldmap. i have seen that tale worlds has fixed some of these issues with the hotfix... but im not sure how these havent already been completely patched out before ea release 3.dialogue now im not sure if taleworlds thinks its fanbase are stupid... but its pretty obvious that over half the dialogue is the exact same as it is from warband 10 years ago.I was really looking forward to seeing what new stuff i could say to lords and bandits, but ended up just being dissapointed with the same old stuff. Now this is a much smaller issue and id rather the devs fix the performance issues or something more important first but it is still pretty ridiculous that they are using ten year old dialouge... it could well be just to try to create nostalgia similiar to what they did with the music (which was done really well as it wasnt just exacly the same music as warband) but it just comes accross as lazy.now... i could continue my list but i highly doubt anyone will look into this so its not really worth it... But! if you want to change my mind or correct me on something do leave a commentUpdate!Taleworlds have now added plenty of patches that have improved the performance and removed most crashes.i will now say that i recommend this game to some extent. Its fun for a while however i would still wait for the full release as the lack of new features still leaves the game feeling empty and like a remaster of warband.  After waiting for this for so long i am still displeased with the state of the game. However i am impressed with taleworlds pumping out patches so frequently. But this is not enough for me to totally change my opinion so i will still leave this review as not recommended. It is likely to stay that way until Taleworlds deliver a game that i personally feel is acceptable for the time spent on the development. I am happy that i can finally play the game without the game crashing or having low performance now though. That was one of my main issues and im glad they fixed it!Keep up the good work talewords!Edit 30/11/2020still aint got any worthwhile updates that make it feel like its worth the wait, only updating for the steam awards lol', helpful='67 people found this review helpful, 2 people found this review funny', rewards=0, hrs_on_record=307.9),\n",
       " SteamReview(text=\"Multiplayer review: The MP is far less polished than Mount & Blade: Warband. It's clear that the developers didn't really put much thought into that, which is mostly what I'm interested in. The combat is an overcooked mess (and not even good) and the class system is designed against players fun. They didn't take inspiration from warband they just made a completely different game. I played warband competitively for years and they didn't even bother making a scene for us in bannerlord, removed our main competitive gamemode (battle) and replaced it with skirmish, which is honestly boring. They won't even let us choose our own equipment anymore, now they have pre-made classes with PERKS instead of actual reasonable economy management. They went from being MEDIEVAL CS-GO to being MEDIEVAL ♥♥♥♥ OVERWATCH. The main competitive gamemode feels like team deathmatch. This game is a step back from warband, even the graphics look dated, they stayed a bit too long in closed development. I'm not saying the game is unredeemable but if you're looking for a competitive experience for multiplayer I can't recommend it.Positives: seems to be a good engine for mod development so hopefully there'll be battle and free equipment choices soon. cRPG or Mercenaries would take off in this gameSingleplayer: It's better than multiplayer but it's not good, feels like a completely different game from the multiplayer.

       " SteamReview(text='This is most certainly an early access review, and it\\'s possible that half of the things I write here will be rendered moot in the coming months. I am also in the process of ordering some new RAM for my computer so this game will likely perform better in another week or two. With those things in mind, I don\\'t want to waste too much time writing a full article-sized review. Instead, I\\'ll just start listing off things I do and don\\'t like.I love the battles! I mean, it\\'s the major gameplay loop of the whole game so it damn well better be enjoyable. The combat itself is a mixed bag, my swings or shots often don\\'t connect when I think they should but that could be a stuttering issue.I think the ordering of troops could be done with a smoother UI. I\\'m not sure how, but there is a hell of a learning curve when you want to start ordering each and every type of unit (between infantry, cavalry, and archers)... Trying to tell them all to do different things before your enemies horse army rides up your anus is a chore and a half. And you will eventually have to get them to do other things. Since you\\'re not going to have a full set of cavalry right out of the gate, I found that forcing everyone to charge would leave my dozens of units of infantry behind while my eight or so horse riders get annihilated. So there\\'s that.I like how the game has immediate mod support. There\\'s already a robust community patch and several things available on the Nexus website that can certainly attribute to some quality of life. Simple things like Mixed Gender Troops, and reputation gain when you take out looters. That mode makes chasing looters down slightly more worth your time rather than just training up unused weapon skills (they\\'re not good for much else pretty quickly). My favorite mod so far might be the one that allows cleave damage, without it all of your weapons only hit one enemy at a time. It\\'s saved my ass more than once.I love the sieges. The mechanics surrounding them have been hit or miss but when it goes well, it feels GREAT. At one point, I was  flanking my nation\\'s army (I didn\\'t attach myself to his main force), protecting them while they built up their siege camp. Then I decided to hit the castle and \"wait\" for the siege to begin, but at the last second... The main army breaks off to fight some defending force, leaving me with the immediate task of fighting off the castle\\'s beefy militia. I lost massively. I like how you don\\'t lose all of your loot when you \\'fail\\', but you do however lose every single one of your troops. I\\'ve had to recover about three times now, which is a tedious chore sometimes.On the flip side of that, I am typically an archery. So I helped a battering ram get through by headshot sniping an entire wall\\'s worth of archers. I\\'ve been in a single, somewhat evenly matched siege with both armies in the 400\\'s and it was an incredibly intense endeavor. Knowing that reinforcements are a finite resource makes watching the enemy\\'s bar go down all the more satisfying. This is essentially what the Civil War questline in Skyrim was supposed to be, but just didn\\'t have the engine or mechanics to handle it.I like how I\\'m not a walking god, even with decent armor. I can cut down large swaths of looters on my own (again, thanks to the \"cut through everything\" mod) but against anything else I actually have to position properly or else I can watch my health melt from arrows. The AI isn\\'t the smartest, but they\\'re not dumb either. I once flanked behind an enemy force but their backline were actually turning around, and backpedaling with their shields up, making my headshots harder to get even though my superior army was advancing on them. What a great feeling to be victorious against an enemy that actually thinks about things like that.I like how dying isn\\'t an instant game over, at least so far. I did uncheck that option. Instead, I\\'m just captured and hauled away before the game gives me a chance to escape and run off.I don\\'t like graphics, and kind of wish it was prettier for a 2020 game. The foliage and sun shafts are nice and all but the models look a decade old. I\\'ve failed an escort quest because I couldn\\'t tell who was who in the town skirmish because the clothing and facial features aren\\'t usually distinct enough.While I am somewhat indifferent on the XP and leveling system (though there are mods to \\'fix\\' that as well), I actually don\\'t like the percentages on some of the perks. One of the first weapon perks you can get is increasing your damage by... 4%? That\\'s almost nothing in the early game when you\\'re hitting for 20\\'s. At best a few perks in is only giving you 2-4 points of bonus damage, and I know that because the damage alerts in the corner actually tell you. That\\'s... almost worthless in the grand scheme of things. So I wish some of the perks had more meat to them.Speaking of, yes, the game is buggy. I haven\\'t suffered many crashes but I have had a ton of performance issues, which I alluded to in the beginning. Some of the quests don\\'t function properly, and some of the perks don\\'t work without mods (like being able to use Longbows on horseback). Again, the plague of early access. The good news is, beneath the problems is a functional and incredibly fun game. I don\\'t fully understand what is making me enjoy this so much, but I\\'ll have plenty of time of introspection in the coming months as the devs continue to work on fixing things.I do not regret this purchase at all, and that\\'s coming from someone who has been burned by early access a few too many times.', helpful='41 people found this review helpful, 2 people found this review funny', rewards=0, hrs_on_record=67.2),\n",

This is also the Audience I think the devs want because politics , Land management , trade , smithing and Rogue characters are all dependant on also being fighters,Here is what I like Combat has never been so good in a game like this , I cannot explain how good it feels to lead an army of Khurzait lancers down the steppes into the front line of some poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ army.Graphics , its not  jaw dropping but it is great to look at.New skill tree has alot of promise shame most of the perks dont work.Here is what I dislike.its a sandbox where the only thing to do is fight. now I know that has always been the mount and blade way but come on why add a smithing and trade tree if their only purpose is to make more money purely for fights when the easiest way to make money on this game is selling high end equipment you get from  fighting armies.Politics comes down to win fights to get influence to spend to get settlements from under other people for no money cost.Factions- factions confuse me , the Imperials especially they are clearly based off of the Romans but their armour and weapons look like a blend between roman inspired but eastern design , they could be placeholder armours and god I hope so. The Vlandians are a mix of Calridians and Rhodoks but less interesting than both in my opinion , The Sturgians are fine and are nords , the Battanians are clearly Brittons but their middle tear troops look like medieval english bowmen but their higher tier troops look like they are from a different time period , or at least I get that feeling I am not too big of English history.Town and castle ownership is a joke all they do really is give you money , and what is money good for? only war or making more money. there is no land to own and manage really no charity to increase your towns respect for you or morale.Trade- The trade perk made me believe my first character could focus on trading and smithing due to there being that perk too , but smithing takes about 1200 days ingame time of smelting every weapon you get and making ores in ingots to get to level 200 to where you get some decent perks that allow you to make weapons that turn a profit worth selling. how ever once you have all the money you could ever want there is nothing to do. unless you then want to take your weak ass character who has no combat skills to war. you can't own a mansion or house and upgrade it to reflect your wealth and standing as the game goes own , raise your kids or stash your gear. If you want to stash gear you literally have to have an entire bloody castle .Relations- This is broken , currently the only way to get your relation up with characters is to murder their armies then let them go or do missions. that doesnt sound so bad until you learn that your wife/husband will stay at 0 like/dislike towards you even as you have kids and then they die.Mods- I love mods ! mods are what got me into PC gaming when I saw how much they could add to games I loved , why is this a bad side? because go to the nexus and see how much work Modders have done in their free time out of passion. they fix or add things that havent been done yet or things that weren't fixed until later. Literally a day after the game came out a mod was made that let you make axes and maces , it took the devs like 3-4 days to make that in a patch. Now i am sure the devs are hard at work and have much love for their game. But come one what went wrong during development where so much was broken that was clearly so easily fixed?I am giving this a negative because people looking at games usually read the negatives first because they are the ones that usually go into detail , like I said above if you want an indepth RPG game where you can be or do anything, you shouldn't get this yet until they update it  more , hell you might never get this because I have the dreadful feeling war is the only thing the devs really plan on doing anything about.I hope I am wrong , this game could be playable for years on and off with the same save file if they added more to do but I ask you to do this to anyone who disagrees with me. Start a new save , give yourself 1 Million gold and what are your options now? there is no point trading because you will never need gold again , no point making your own kingdom and going to war because all that does when you win is give you more gold , no point doing missions or having children or keeping your villages safe. and well done you are now at the end or middle game state for I would wager everyone.\", helpful='90 people found this review helpful, 3 people found this review funny', rewards=1, hrs_on_record=231.0),\n",

       " SteamReview(text='DISCLAIMER! THIS REVIEW IS A BRUTALLY HONEST CRITIQUE OF THE GAME MADE BY A PLAYER WHO HAS PLAYED A LOT OF BOTH BANNERLORD AND THE PREVIOUS, BELOVED TITLE, \"MOUNT&BLADE: WARBAND\", AND WHO IS NOT BLINDED BY ONLY PLAYING TWO HOURS OF SINGLEPLAYER IN EITHER GAME.First off, the steam reviews suck and don\\'t really give any idea about the game other than \"Hey I\\'ve played a couple hours and it\\'s great!\" or \"I\\'ve never played anything other than super mario and chivalry and it\\'s really neat!\" The main forums online for Bannerlord hold true fans of the series who have thousands of hours in Warband and alternatively really many in Bannerlord. They have a bit of a more similar, critical perspective on the game as me.Don\\'t buy the game. It\\'s unfinished, unpolished and really overall just not worth 50€ by any standards. It\\'s a straight-up downgrade from the previous title \"Mount&Blade: Warband\", which was released in 2010. That\\'s over 10 years ago.   It was a beloved cult classic game with an extremely devoted fanbase and modding scene, which I was a part of for many years.   Now Bannerlord doesn\\'t have any of that. While Warband was restricted only by the outdated engine and the fact that it was made by a relatively small indie team, Bannerlord is restricted by absolutely horrible management and greed for that sweet console money.   They claim that after over 8 years in development it\\'s all because \"it\\'s not finished\". The early access was launched over a year ago, and absolutely no notable progress has been made, only minor patches, bug fixes and some features absolutely nobody asked for. The community has made a meme of the terrible time management the developer (Taleworlds) has:When someone asks when a feature or a simple dev update on a matter is coming, many just reply \"Soon™\". This means that, in Taleworlds\\' time, it\\'s at least several months to half a year.  The gameplay has been made simpler just so they can sell more copies to casual console players which is absolutely disgusting. Combat has also been made slower and AI dumber on purpose, so that tactics don\\'t matter.   The infantry has been made dumb on purpose so that cavalry charges are more powerful. The devs have told that (along the lines of) \"it\\'s more fun this way\". Yes if you don\\'t get bored of pressing only two buttons to fight a battle every single time. Zero tactics involved, even if someone tries to tell you otherwise.  The lifeblood of Warband was always the multiplayer communities who would play every day for hours, not unusually on multiplayer mods like Persistent World, cRPG, Mercenaries and Full Invasion 2. We obviously have none of that in Bannerlord. The devs told that Bannerlord will be even more moddable than Warband, but still they haven\\'t given the modders custom server files so they can start making the multiplayer mods. It seems they might\\'ve been annoyed when a certain member of the modding community managed to make their own custom server. It was taken down by the devs.  There is pretty much no communication about any real roadmap or anything of the sorts by the devs. They might release some random minor patch (mostly for singleplayer) once a couple months.  They don\\'t care about multiplayer. As far as we know, there\\'s a couple fellows making it. They\\'ve made the multiplayer according to some dumb fantasy about Bannerlord being the next CS:GO or some other matchmaking based competitivee-sport. There\\'s a major AI exploit in one of the multiplayer modes, Captain mode, which completely defeats the purpose of the mode and can be argued to be complete cheesing of the mechanics.   In Warband, on custom servers with a similar custom gamemode to the Captain mode of Bannerlord, there has for a long time been a fix for the abuse. Still the devs haven\\'t done anything to prevent the AI abuse. They have told that \"soon™\" it\\'ll be fixed. I\\'m pretty certain it\\'s been several months already since it was said.Also, there are rumors that Taleworlds will begin work on a sci-fi space game, while their current project is broken, plain and outright unfinished. Just disgusting how they can even think about making a new game when the last one is so unfinished. Are they just going to call a half-made game a finished product and sell it for a full price? Apparently.Here are quite the reasons not to buy the game until the devs get their s*** back together and stop at one point pretending it\\'s a finished game and only polishing it, and at the other telling people that \"it\\'s in early access and not finished yet\". If it\\'s in early access, maybe implement actual big changes and stop messing around with something as small and useless as minor balance changes to weapon stats.', helpful='90 people found this review helpful, 6 people found this review funny', rewards=5, hrs_on_record=575.3),\n",
       " SteamReview(text=\"This is the game we were waiting for. Sadly the it meme won't work anymore. And well... the game left me a bit disappointed.Waiting all this time I, and I know many others, were expecting a lot. And don't get me wrong it is still a fun game, but it feels a bit like a reskinned version of (the holy) Warband. For 40 euro's and 12 centuries of waiting I expected more.Why would I still recommend it? Because: It is mount and blade, the sieges did improve, combat is slightly better, crafting, better settlement management. But these increases are relatively small. I found myself sometimes going back to Warband because it simply... felt better. (This could be nostalgia)I still love playing the game and I would recommend buying it (especially if you haven't played the older ones), but I'd say wait for a sale at least until it comes out of beta. I hope the developers carry on their good work. Maybe when it goes out of Beta it is a more solid experience.\", helpful='46 people found this review helpful, 1 person found this review funny', rewards=6, hrs_on_record=163.9),\n",
       " SteamReview(text=\"This is a review complementing the dedication of the Dev team for this entire game, and also to give insight on the foolish people criticizing Taleworlds for Bannerlord not being developed. First of I want to say, that Taleworlds has been fantastic on the response by their team on fixing all sorts of issues, and balancing the game in just a couple days of launch. (Remember if you are playing start a new game, to have the patches be implemented fully)Second, I want to state that I am highly impressed, and very thankful that they built an entire gaming engine from scratch just to create Bannerlord. It is important to note, that is more than likely where most of the time went for the 8 years Bannerlord was in production. They created an entirely new engine just for Bannerlord. The modding capabilities that they have added to this new engine, are terrific, and allow for easy use, so that we can have even greater mods than before. (Look at Kingdom of Arda, the current LOTR mod in production) Not only all of that, but they implemented Multiplayer in a very effective way.Third thing I would like to state is. The devs said the game would not be complete in a finished state for at least another year, they have many things that are seen in the game, but not implemented fully yet. Things such as Voice acting, Kingdom Diplomacy, certain quests, Gang battles, and etc Much of this will be improved upon, and delivered within the Year. This game is EARLY ACCESS, and NO they did not spend 8 years on just making Bannerlord (much of the time was spent on making a brand new engine from the ground up). However, I see the potential in everything they are adding for Bannerlord, I love the multiplayer, and the Modding tools they made for the community are some of the best tools I have seen ever. (I can't wait to fight Dwarves, Ents, and Cave Trolls in the LOTR mod currently being made)\", helpful='93 people found this review helpful, 7 people found this review funny', rewards=0, hrs_on_record=191.3),\n",

       " SteamReview(text='A standalone expansion pack was released for 2008’s Mount & Blade video game, taking place approximately 210 years before its predecessor. The setting is heavily inspired by the Migration Period and offering a perfect blend of ARPG (Action Role-playing) and Strategy game elements. The premise of the game is the same gameplay offered by previous titles in the series, in which the player establishes a party of legendary soldiers and attempt to complete challenging quests on a campaign map. Like previous titles, battles are played on battlefields that enable you to engage in epic combat alongside your trained troops. However, the game made significant changes to gameplay’s elements. In this title, you find Sieges more strategic as compared to Warband, and the player may build a series of siege engines and can deploy them strategically before the battle starts to target specific sections of the opposing team’s fortifications. Real-life Graphics and High-level Strategic PerspectiveAfter spending lots of hours with Mount & Blade II: Bannderlord, I could say that it is offering much prettier gameplay than its predecessor, titled Mount and Blade: Warband. This time, you will discover gorgeous maps, enabling you to scroll from overhead to a high-level strategic perspective. All introduced aspects like lightening effects, terrain, textures, etc. are all excellent and the detailed graphics really make me feel I’m in a real-world environment.An improved interface awaits you; in short, the game is visually pleasing and well-organized as it is easy to work with. Lots of things are there that don’t have any tooltips which, in my opinion, were better explained, and when you start playing the game, for sure, you will find out some significant amount of lag upon attempting to switch between menus. Despite having such lags, I appreciate the step the developer took from the janky interface of Warband that makes me feel like a fresh breath in the air.Moreover, the game chooses the fictional continent of Calradia for its setting and takes place approximately 210 years before the event of its predecessor. The plot starts with the decline of the Calradic Empire and the formation of the factions found in Warband. The crisis of the Calradic Empire is familiar to you as it happened with the Roman Empire during the Migration Period and the formation of North African, European, as well as Middle Eastern of Middle Ages. The introduced stuff like clothes, armor, weapons, and structure of each faction is heavily inspired by real-world counterparts from 600 to 1100 AD.    Up to eight playable factions are there, and each one is beautifully composed to compete against minor factions with specific goals. The introduction of the Single-player campaign lets you play the game the way you love and allows you to decide your path to rule over the world in a dynamic sandbox adventure like never before. In the Single-player campaign, the content is randomly generated; it means no two walkthroughs will be the same.Despite having annoying bugs, there are lots of new exciting things to discover. Since the release, developers are trying their best to fix copious crashes and broken systems to offer you a smooth experience. Upon excluding a few lacks, the overall experience was fantastic, and you should also try it out at once to make yourself addict to it.
